            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To the Church of England, and ALL THOSE THAT LOVE THE TRVETH IN IT, T. C.</hi> wiſheth mercy and peace / from God our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>AS our men do more willingly go to warfare / and fyght with greater cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage agaynſt ſtraungers / then agaynſt theyr countreymen: ſo it is with me in thys ſpirituall warfare. For I would haue wyſhed that thys contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy had bene with the Papyſtes / or with other (if any can be) more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtylent and profeſſed ennemyes of the church: for that ſhould haue bene les griefe to wryte / and more conuement to perſwade that which I deſire. For as the very name of an ennemy doth kyndle the deſire of fyghting / and ſtirreth vp the care of preparing the furniture for the warre: So I can not tell how it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe / that the name of a brother ſtaketh that courage / and abateth that carefulnes which ſhould be beſtowed in deſence of the truth. But ſeeing the truth ought not to be forſaken for any mans cauſe / I enforced my ſelfe / conſidering that if the Lord myght lay it to my charge / that I was not for certayne conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſo ready as I ought to haue bene to publyſhe the truth / he myght more iuſtly condemne me / if being oppugned and ſlaundered by others / I ſhould not according to that meaſure which he hath dealte vnto me / and for my ſmall haby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie defend it / and delyuer it from the euill report that ſome endeuor to bring vpon it. And as vnto other partes of the goſpell / ſo ſone as the Lord openeth a dore for them to enter in / there is for the moſt part great reſiſtance: ſo in thys part concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the gouernment and dyſcipline of the church / which is the order which God hath left / as well to make the doctryne moſt effectuall / and to geue as it were a ſharper edge vnto the preaching of the word / as alſo to be a wall to keepe it / and make it contynue among vs / I ſee there be ſondry lettes / which doe as it were with weapons ſtande vp to ſtoppe the paſſage / and to hynder that it ſhould not be ſetled amongſt vs. With the which albeit I wraſtle hande to hande in thys booke / yet for as much as we haue all dronke ſo deepe of the cuppe of vntruth / that we do not only ſtumble at blockes / which other men lay in our way / but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes we gather lettes vnto our ſelues in framyng a preiudice agaynſt the truth: I thought good to note ſhortly what thoſe ſtumbling blockes are / and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I can not remoue them / yet to geue warning of them / and to lende my hand to the weaker and ſimpler ſort to helpe to ouerſtride them.</p>
            <p>The offences which are taken herein / be eyther in reſpect of the cauſe / or in reſpect of thoſe / which ſeeke to defend / and promote the cauſe. The cauſe is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged firſt with newnes / and ſtrangenes / then as author of confuſion / and of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der / and laſt of all as enemy to princes / magiſtrates / and common wealthes. For the firſt / beſides that it is no ſufficient chalenge / to ſay it is new &amp; ſtrange / there is no cauſe why it ſhould be counted new / which is confeſſed of thoſe which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke it / to haue bene for the moſt part / vſed in the Apoſtles tymes / nor why it ſhould be eſteemed ſtraunge / which is vſed now farre / and neare / of thys &amp; that ſide the ſea / and of no ſtrangers / but of thoſe which are of the houſholde of fayth. And it ſhall more largely appeare in thys Booke / that thys is no innouation / but a renouation / and the doctrine not new / but renued / no ſtranger / but borne in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / whereunto (it being before vniuſtly banyſhed) ought now of ryght to bee reſtored.</p>
            <p>And of confuſion &amp; dyſorder it is yet more vntruely accuſed. For iuſtice may be as well accuſed for doing wrong / as thys doctryne / for bringing in diſorder / whoſe whole worke is to prouyde / that nothing be done out of place / out of time / or otherwiſe / then the condytion of euery mans calling will beare: which putteth the people in ſubiection vnder their gouernoures / the gouernoures in degree / and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21261:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> order one vnder an other / as the Elder / vnderneath the Paſtor / and the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con / vnderneath the Elder / whych teacheth / that a Particuler church / ſhall giue place vnto a Prouinciall ſynode / where many churches are / and the Prouincial / to a Nationall / and likewyſe that / vnto the Generall / if anye be / and all vnto Chriſte / and his worde. When on the contrary parte / thoſe whych ſtand againſt thys doctrine / are thereby compelled to bryng into the church great confuſion / and maruellous diſorder / whileſt the paſtors office is confounded wyth the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons / whileſt women do miniſter the ſacraments / whych is lawful only for men: whileſt priuate men do that / whych belongeth vnto publicke perſons: whileſt publicke actions / are done in priuate places: whileſt the church / is ſhuffled wyth the common wealth: whileſt ciuill matters / are handled by Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons / and Eccleſiaſticall / by thoſe whych be ciuill: and to be ſhort / whileſt no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the church keepeth his ſtanding / and one member doth take vpon it / the office of an other. Which things as they hazard the arme / and deſtroy the body: ſo they do preſently hinder / and will ſhortly (if remeady be not prouided) vtterly ouerthrowe the churche. And therefore onles good order be in that whych was brought into the church by poperye / and confuſion in that whych was left vnto the church by the Apoſtles / and that it be order / that publike actions / ſhould be done in priuate places / by priuate perſons / and by women / that is appoynted to be done by men / and confuſion / when the contrary is obſerued / and finally / onles order / haue an other definition or nature / then hitherto hath bene read / or heard of / there is no cauſe / why this doctrine which containeth the diſcipline / and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the churche / ſhould be thus ſhamefully ſlaundered wyth confuſion / and diſorder.</p>
            <p>For the third poynt / whych is / that it is an enemy to magiſtrates / and the common wealth: if it be enough to accuſe wythout proufe / to ſay and ſhewe no reaſon / innocency it ſelfe ſhall not be giltles. Thys doctrine was in times paſt / euen by their confeſſion / which wryte againſt it / a friend vnto princes and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates / when princes / and magiſtrates were enemies vnto it: and can it nowe be an enemy vnto princes / and magiſtrates / whych are frendes vnto it? It helped / and vpholded the common wealths / whych were gouerned by tyrantes / and can it hinder thoſe / whych are gouerned by godly princes? And in what is it an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to princes / and magiſtrates? Note the variance / ſet downe the enemitie. If the queſtion be / whether princes / and magiſtrates be neceſſary in the church / it holdeth / that the vſe of them / is more then of the ſunne / wythout the whych the world ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ſtand. I fit be of their honor / it holdeth / that wyth humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſſion of minde / the outward alſo of the body / yea the body it ſelfe / and all that it hath / if nede ſo require / are to be yelded / for the defence of the prince / and for that ſeruice / for the whych the prince will vſe them vnto / for the glory of God / and maintenance of the common wealth. If it be aſked of the obedience due vnto the prince / and vnto the magiſtrate / it anſweareth that all obedience in the Lord / is to be rendred: and if it come to paſſe / that any other be aſked / it ſo refuſeth / that it diſobayeth not / in preferring obedience to the great God / before that whych is to be geuen to mortall man. It ſo reſiſteth / that it ſubmitteth the body / and goodes of thoſe that profeſſe it / to abide that whych God will haue them ſuffer in that caſe. And if it be ſhewed / that this is neceſſary for the church / it can not be / but profitable for the common wealth: nay the profit of it / may eaſly appeare / for that by the cenſures / and diſcipline of the church / as they are in thys booke deſcribed / men are kept back from committing of great diſorders of ſtealing / adultry / mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. &amp;c. whileſt the ſmalleſt faultes of lying / and vncomely ieſting / of harde and cholericke ſpeaches / whych the magiſtrate doth not commonly puniſhe / be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21261:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> were ſicke togither / and well togither / laughed togither / and weeped togither / and alwayes like affected: it can not be / but that the breaches of the common wealth / haue proceeded from the hurtes of the church / and the wants of the one / from the lackes of the other. Neyther is it to be hoped for / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the common wealth ſhall flouriſhe / vntill the church be reformed.

I will therfore make an end of theſe poynts / conſidering that the vntruth of theſe accuſations of newnes and ſtraungenes / of diſorder and confuſion / of being ennemy to princes and common wealthes / ſhall better appeare in the diſcourſe of thys boke.</p>

            <p>Vnto the firſt / although anſwer is made more at large / in this boke / yet I wil adde thus much / that as for my part / I confes my ſelf / to be a great deale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior vnto the leaſt of them: ſo the omitting of theſe neceſſary things / ought to be no more preiudice againſt them / or againſt thoſe that prefer them / then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> omitting of the celebration of the feaſt of tabernacles / ſo many hundreth yeres / by ſo many good high prieſts / in the raignes of ſo many good kings / was preiudicial vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> miniſters / which cauſed it to be celebrated / when the people returned out of their captiuitie / for it appeareth in the boke of Nehemias / that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feaſt of tabernacles / <note place="margin">8 Chap. 17. 18</note> which was commaunded of the Lord to be celebrated euery yeare / was not cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in ſuch ſort / as it was commaunded in the law / from the dayes of Ioſua / the ſonne of Nun / vntill the returne of the people from their captiuitie. And yet were there / in this ſpace / diuers bothe iudges / and kings / both prieſtes / and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſingularly zealous / and learned. If therfore the omitting of ſo neceſſary a thing / ſo many hundreth yeares / by ſuche godly zealous learned perſons / could not bring any preſcription / againſt the truth: the lacke of this neceſſary diſcipline / by the ſpace of. 30. yeares / through the ouerſight of a fewe (if they be compared with that multitude) ought not to be alledged / to kepe it out of the church.</p>
            <p>The dignitie alſo / and hygh eſtate of thoſe / whych are not ſo earneſt in thys cauſe / can not hinder it / if we conſider / the wiſdome of God / almoſt from time to time / to conſiſt / and to ſhew it ſelfe moſt in ſetting forth his truth / by the ſimpler /

Cor. 1. 27. 28</note> they might the more wonder at the wiſedome / and power of the artificer / which wyth ſo weake / and fooliſhe inſtruments / bringeth to paſſe ſo wiſe / and mighty things. And if men will wyth ſuch an eye of fleſhe / loke vpon matters / they ſhall condemne that excellent reformation / vnder the godly king Ezechias / whych the holy ghoſt doth ſo highly commend: in whych it is witneſſed / that the Leuites / <note place="margin">2.

Yea wherin it is witneſſed / that the people were yet more earneſt / and more willing / then either the Leuites / or the prieſtes. Whych thing / if euer / is verified in our time. For when I conſider the zeale for religion / whych ſheweth it ſelfe / in many / as well of the nobility / and gentry of this realme / as of the people / their care to continue it / and aduaunce it / their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary charges to maintaine it / their liberality towards them / which bend them ſelues that way / as I do therby conceiue ſome hope / of the fauourable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce / and continuance of Gods goodnes towards vs: ſo I can not be but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of mine owne ſlackenes / and afraid of the diſpleaſure of the Lord / for that thoſe / whoſe proper worke thys is eſpecially / and whych ſhould beare the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darde / and cary the torche vnto the reſt / are ſo colde / and ſo careles in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And I humbly craue / and moſt earneſtly deſire of thoſe / whych beare the cheefe titles in the Eccleſiaſticall functions / that as we doe in parte correct oure negligence / by the example of the forwardnes / and readines of the people: ſo they would ſuffer themſelues / to be put in remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their dueties / by vs / which are vnderneath them / and that they would not neglect thys golden gift of Gods grace / in admoniſhing them / becauſe the Lord doth offer it in a treene / or earthen veſſell / but that they would firſt conſider / that as * Naaman the Syrian prince / <note place="margin">2. Kin. 5. 4. 14</note> receiued great commodity / by following / the aduiſe of his maide / and after / of his man: And * Abigael being a wiſe woman / ſinguler profit / by obeying the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25. 18</note> of her ſeruaunt: ſo they may receiue oftentimes profitable aduertiſement / by thoſe / whych are in lower places then they them ſelues be. Then let them thynke that as Naaman was neuer the les noble / for obeying the voyce of his ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts / nor Abigaell neuer the les wiſe / becauſe ſhe liſtened vnto the words of her man / ſo it can not deminiſhe their true honoure / nor empaire the credite of their godly and vncounterfait wiſdome / if they geue care vnto that / which is ſpoken by their inferioures.</p>
            <p>And laſt of all / that as / if they had not liſtened vnto thoſe ſimple perſons / the one had peariſhed in his leproſie / the other had bene ſlaine with her familye: euen ſo / if they ſhall for any worldly reſpect of honor / riches / or feare of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted eyther vnaduiſed in taking this courſe / or light / or inconſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in forſaking it / ſtop their cares againſt thys louing Admonition of the Lorde / they prouoke hys anger / not againſt their health / or againſt their life / but againſt their owne ſoules / by exerciſing of vnlawfull authority / and by taking vnto them partly ſuch things / as belong by no meanes vnto the church / and partly whych are common vnto them / wyth the whole church / or els wyth other the miniſters / and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the ſame / wherof I beſeche them humbly to take the better hede / for that the iudgement of the Lord wil be vpon a great part of them / by ſo much the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier / by how much / they haue not only beleued the goſpel / but alſo haue receyued this grace of God / that they ſhould ſuffer for it. So that if they wil neither take example of diuers their ſuperiors the nobles of this realme / nor be admoniſhed by vs of the lower ſort (wherin we hope better of them) yet they would remember their former times / and correct them ſelues / by them ſelues. And ſeing they haue ben content for the goſpels ſake / to quit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neceſſary things of this life / they wold
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21261:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> not thinke much / for the diſcipline / whych is no ſmall parte of the goſpel (hauing both things neceſſary and commodious) to part from that / whych is not only in them ſuperfluous / and hath nothing but a vaine oſtentation (whych will vaniſh as the ſhadow) but alſo is hurtfull vnto them / and pernicious vnto the churche / whych thing I do morelargely / and plainly lay forth in thys boke.</p>
            <p>Another exception againſt the fauorers of this cauſe / is taken / for that they propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it out of time / whych is that the Iewes ſayd / that the time was not yet come to build the Lordes houſe: but it is knowen / what the * Prophet anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <note place="margin">1. Agg. 234.</note> And if no time were vnſeaſonable / in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinde of materiall building / wherin there be ſome times (as of ſummer) more opportune and fit then others: howe can there be any vntimely building / in this ſpirituall houſe / where as long / as it is called to day / men are commaunded to further thys worke. And as for thoſe which ſay we come to late / and that this ſhuld haue bene done in the beginning / and cannot now be done / wythout the ouerthrow of all / for mending of a peece: they do little conſider / that * S. Paul compareth that which is good in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 12. 13</note> vnto gold / and ſiluer / and precious ſtones / and that whych is euil layd vpon the foundation / vnto ſtubble / and hey / and wode. Likewiſe therfore / as the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the hey / and the wode be eaſely by the fire conſumed / wythout any loſſe vnto the gold / or ſiluer / or precious ſtones: ſo the corrupt things in this building / may be eaſely taken away / wythout any hurt / or hinderance vnto that which is pure / and found. And if they put ſuch confidence in thys ſimilitude / as that they wil therby / wythout any teſtimony of the word of God / ſtay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> further building / or correcting the faultes of the houſe of the Lorde (whych by his manifeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement ought to be done wyth all ſpede) then beſides that they be very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunning builders / whych can not mende the faultes / wythout ouerthrow of all / (eſpecially when as the fault / is not in the foundation) they muſt remembre / that as the meane / whych is vſed to gather the children of God / is called a building / ſo is it called a planting. And therfore as dead twigs / riotous / and ſuperfluous braunches / or whatſoeuer hindreth the groweth of the vine tree / may be cut of / wythout roting vp the vine: ſo the vnprofitable things of the church / may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away / without any ouerthrow of thoſe things / which are well eſtabliſhed. And ſeeing that Chriſt / and Beliall can not agree / it is ſtraunge / that the pure <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 15.</note> doctrine of the one / &amp; the corruptions of the other / ſhould cleaue ſo faſt togither / that pure doctrine / can not be wyth her ſafetie / ſeuered from the corruptions / when as they are rather like vnto that part of Daniels image / which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <note place="margin">Cap. 2. 42. 43.</note> of clay and iron / &amp; therfore could not cleaue / or ſticke one with an other.</p>
            <p>It is further ſayde / that the ſetters forwarde of thys cauſe / are contentious / and in mouing queſtions / giue occaſion to the papiſts of ſlaundring the religion / and to the weake of offence. But if it be found to be both true which is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded / and a thing neceſſary about which we contende / then hath thys accuſation no grounde to ſtande on.

For ſondry of thoſe thinges / which are comprehended in the anſwere to the Admonition / haue (as I am perſwaded) few fauourers / of thoſe eſpecially / which are of any ſtayed / or ſounder iudgement in the ſcriptures / and haue ſene / or red of the gouernment / and order of other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: ſo that in deede (the father of that anſwere excepted) we haue thys contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy oftentymes / rather with the papiſtes / then with thoſe which profeſſe the goſpell / as we do. And whereas laſt of all / it is ſayde / that thys procedeth of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy / of ſingularitie / and of popularitie / although theſe be no ſufficient reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the truth of the cauſe / which is neyther enuyous / ſingular / nor popular / and althoughe they be ſuche / as myght be ſeuerally / by great lykelyhodes / and probalyties refuted / yet becauſe the knowledge of theſe thinges / pertayneth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God which is the ſearcher of the hart and raynes / and for auoyding of too <note place="margin">Act. 1. 24.</note> muche tediouſneſſe / we will reſt in his iudgement / tary for the day wherein the ſecretes of hartes ſhall be made manyfeſt. And yet all men do ſee / how vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we be accuſed of ſingularity / which propound nothing / that the ſcriptures do not teache / the wryters bothe olde / and new for the moſt part affirme / the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the primitiue churches / and of thoſe which are at theſe dayes confirme.</p>
            <p>All theſe accuſations / as well agaynſt the cauſe / as the fauourers thereof / al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they be many and dyuers / yet are they no other / then which haue bene long ſithens in the Prophets / Apoſtles / and our ſauior Chriſtes / and now of late in our tymes obiected agaynſt the trueth / and the profeſſors therof. And therefore / as the ſunne of the truth then appeared / &amp; brake through all thoſe cloudes / which roſe agaynſt it / to ſtoppe the lyght of it: ſo no doubt thys cauſe / being of the ſame nature / will haue the ſame effect. And as all thoſe ſlaunders could not bryng the truth in diſgrace / with thoſe that loued it: ſo the children of the truth / through theſe vntrue reportes / will neyther leaue the loue of thys cauſe / which they haue already conceaued: nor yet ceaſe to enquire dyligently / and to iudge indifferently / of thoſe ſurmiſes / which are put vp agaynſt it.</p>
            <p>Moreouer / ſeing that we haue once ouercomed all theſe lets / and clymed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them / when they were caſt in our way / to hynder vs from coming from the groſſe darknes of popery / vnto the gloryous lyght of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell: there is no cauſe / why now they ſhould ſtaye our courſe to further perfection / conſidering / that neyther the ſtyle is hygher nowe / then it was before (being the very ſelfe ſame obiections) and in all thys tyme / we ought ſo to haue growne in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth / that in ſtead of being then able to leape ouer a hedge / we ſhould now haue our feete ſo prepared by the goſpell / that they ſhould be as the fecte of a hynde / hable to ſurmount euen a wall if neede were.</p>
            <p>The ſumme of all is: that the cauſe may be looked vpon with a ſingle eye / without all miſte of partialitie / may be heard with an indifferent care / without the waxe of preiudice: the argumentes of both ſides / may be waighed / not with the chaungeable waightes of cuſtome / of tyme / of men / which notwithſtanding (Popiſhe excepted) ſhall be ſhewed to be more for the cauſe then agaynſt it: but with the iuſt balances of the incorruptible / and vnchangeable worde of God.</p>

Doctors anſwer / and my reply / both that thou mayſt the better vnderſtand the truth of the cauſe / and that the vntempered ſpeches (of hym eſpecially that whyppeth other ſo ſharply for them) which I haue in a maner altogether paſſed by / and hys loſe concluſions / which I haue (to auoyde tedyouſnes) not ſo fully purſued may the better appeare. Which thing as I craue to be done through the whole booke / ſo chefely / I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it may be done in the beginning / where the reader ſhall not be able ſo well to vnderſtand what is ſayde of me / vnleſſe he haue M. D. booke before hym. The cauſe of which diuerſitie / roſe of that / that I firſt purpoſed to ſet downe his anſwer before my reply / as he dyd the admonition before hys anſwer. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſidering that (hys booke being already in the handes of men) it would be double charges to bye it agayne: and eſpecially weighing with my ſelfe / that through the ſlownes of the prynt / for want of helpe / the reply by that meanes ſhould come forth later / then was conuenient (for although he myght commody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bryng in the admonition / being ſhort / yet the ſame coulde not be done in his booke / ſwellyng in that ſort which it doth.) I ſay / theſe thinges conſydered / I changed my mynde / and haue therfore ſet downe the cauſes / which moued me ſo to doe / becauſe I know / that thoſe (if any be) which haue determyned to conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue theyr foreiudged opynions agaynſt the cauſe / whatſoeuer be alledged / wyll hereupon take occaſion to ſurmyſe / that I haue left out hys anſwere / to the end / that it myght the leſſe appeare / wherein I haue paſſed ouer any weyght of hys reaſons: where as / had it not bene for theſe cauſes which I haue before aledged / my earneſt deſire was / to haue ſet hys anſwere before my reply: whereof I call the Lord to wytneſſe / whom I know to be a ſharpe iudge agaynſt thoſe / which ſhall abuſe hys holy name to any vntruth.</p>

But if there be any place of coniecture / the hatred of contention / whych you ſet downe / as the firſt and principall cauſe / that beat you backe from wryting / might well haue ben put / as the laſt and leaſt / or rather none at all. For if peace had bene ſo precious vnto you (as you pretend) you woulde not haue brought ſo many hard wordes / bitter reproches / enemylike ſpeaches (as it were ſtickes and coales) to double / and treble / the heat of contention. If the ſharpnes of the Admonition miſliked you / and you thinke they outreached in ſome vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of words / how could you more effectually haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed that / then to haue in a quiet and milde ſpirite ſet them in the way / which (in your opinion) had left it? now in words condenming it / and approuing it in your dedes / I wil not ſay / that you do not ſo much miſlike thys ſharpness / as you are ſory / that you are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented / and are not the firſt in it: But this I may well ſay vnto you / whych he ſayd: <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi> what ſhould I heare words / when I ſee the dedes?

               <head>An anſwere to that which is called a briefe examination of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vſed in the Admonition to the Parliament.</head>
               <p>IF the ſcriptures had bene applyed to the mayntenaunce of the abhomination of the maſſe / and ſome other of the groſſeſt of antichriſtianitie / you could haue ſayd no more / nor vſed vehementer ſpeache then thys / that they are moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerably abuſed / and vnlearnedly applyed. And then where is charitie / which <note place="margin">Pro. 10. 12.</note> couereth the multitude of faultes / eſpecially in brethren / when you do not only not couer them / but alſo take away their garmentes / whereby they are couered. I will not deny / but that there be ſome few places quoted / whych might haue bene ſpared / but there are a great number / which (M. Doctor) toſſeth &amp; throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away ſo lightly / which he ſhall perceiue to ſit nearer him / then he is / or at the leaſt ſometh to be aware of. And to bring to paſſe that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> quotations in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent might appeare to the reader more abſurde / M. Doctor hath beſides the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage which he taketh of the faultes of the Printer / vſed two vnlawfull prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſies eſpecially. Wherof the one is / that where as the admonition doth quote the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21261:8"/> ſcripture / not only to proue the matters which it handleth / but ſometimes alſo to note the place from whence the phraſe of ſpeache is taken. M. Doctor doth go about to make hys reader beleue / that thoſe places which be alledged for profe of the phraſe / are quoted for proofe of the matter. The other practiſe is / that where the Admonition (for the ſhortnes whych it promiſeth / and was neceſſary in that caſe) could not apply the places / M. Doctor preſuming too muche of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hys reader / thought he might make him beleue / that any thing elſe was meant by thoſe places / then that which they meant in deede / and for which they were alledged. And where you ſay the quotations are only to delude ſuch. &amp;c. I ſee you holde it no fault in your ſelfe / which you condemne ſo preciſely in others / that is / to iudge before the time / to ſit in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience / to affirme definitely of their thoughts / contrary to their owne proteſtation. But ſeeing you lift vp our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſo high / and ſet them as it were vpon a ſtage for all men to be loked of / to the diſcredite of the truth which we do mayntayne: You ſhall not thinke muche / if your pouertie be poynted vnto / in thoſe things wherin you would cary ſo great countenaunce of ſtore. For the argumentes them ſelues / they ſhall be ſeene what they be in their places / ſo ſhall alſo that be anſwered / which M. Doctor bringeth heere for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Confutation / being ſtraightway after / &amp; in ſondry other places repea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted in thys booke. I will touche that which is not repeated / &amp; that is / that M.

Thys ſauoureth ſtrongly of the ſecte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Adamites.</p>
               <p>S. Paul whych commendeth the preſeruation of godlynes and peace / vnto <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 2.</note> the cyuill magiſtrate / doth alſo commende vnto hym the prouyding / that honeſty be kept / and M.

And if the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which knew not god / did accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it a filthy thing for a ſtage player to come vpon the ſtage without a ſloppe / how much more filthy is it / for a Chriſtian / to come naked vnto the Lordes table? and the contrary thereof / is neceſſarily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of the ſcripture / notwithſtanding that M. Doctor ſayeth otherwiſe. They which haue heard M. Doctor read in the ſcholes can tell / that he being there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt learned men / neuer vſed to reduce the contrary argumentes of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes / to the places of the fallacions / and yet that was the fitteſt place for hym to haue ſhewed hys knowledge in / becauſe there they ſhould haue bene beſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtode: now that he profeſſeth hym ſelfe to be a doctor of the people / which becauſe they haue not learned theſe things / can not vnderſtande them / he daſheth out his Logicke. What may be probably gathered hereof / I leaue to euery mans conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: thys is certen / that circumſtances of place and perſons / which he ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vrgeth / are not well obſerued of him / when Logike ſpeaketh in the church / and is mute in the ſchooles: when things are handled more learnedly amongſt the people / and more popularly amongſt the learned. It is truely ſayde / <hi>cakon eſti to calon, en ti me kairoutiche.</hi> A good thing is euill / when it cometh out of ſeaſon. But to obſerue what Arte heere is ſhewed / I would gladly know what place of the fall actions / eyther an argument <hi>ab authoritate negatiue</hi> is / or of negatiues by compariſon. Ariſtotle ſetting forth places / whereunto all fallacions may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led / maketh no mention of theſe / and if theſe were fallacions / and were ſuch as he imagineth them / they ſhould be referred vnto the former place / <hi>ab eo quod eſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid, ad id quod est ſimpliciter,</hi> for theſe reaſons / the ſcripture hath it not / therefore it ought not to be / or the miniſter was knowen by doctryne / therefore by doctryne only / and not by apparell: If I ſay they be fallacions / they be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto that place / and whether they be or no / and alſo how corruptly / and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then is meant they be gathered / it ſhall afterward appeare. In the meane ſeaſon in a ſmall matter / heere is a great fault / not only to inuent new places / but of one place to make three / and may as well make a thouſande.</p>

               <p> And to the ende the pithe and waight of M. Doctors argumentes may be the better ſeene / I will lykewiſe geue the reader a ſay of them / noting the places of the fallacions / whereunto they be referred. Which I do agaynſt my will / and compelled / for that maiſter Doctor to diſcredite the truthe / would make hys rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beleeue / that thoſe which thinke not as he doth in theſe matters / are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnlearned / but contenurers of all good learning. In deede there is no greate learning in theſe final things / &amp; they are of that ſort / which although it be a great ſhame not to know / yet it is no great commendation to haue knowledge of them.</p>
               <p>In the 40. page he reaſoneth thus. The miniſters muſt learne / therfore they muſt learne Catechiſmes: which is a fallaction of the conſequent. For although he that muſt learne a Cathechiſme / muſt learne: yet it followeth not / that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer muſt learne / muſt by and by learne a Cathechiſme.</p>
               <p>In the. 55. page he reaſoneth / that for ſo much as the cyuill magiſtrate may appoynt ſome kinde of apparell / therfore he may appoynt any / and ſo the popiſhe apparell. Which is / <hi>ab eo quod eſt ſecundum quid, ad id quod eſt ſimpliciter:</hi> of which ſort he hath dyuers others. As women may baptiſe / and preache / becauſe ſuch a one / and ſuch a one dyd. And the miniſters execute cyuill gouernment / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Elias / and Samuell did.</p>
               <p>In the. 69. page he ſayth. Cyprian (ſpeaking of the office of an archbyſhop) which is a manifeſt petition of the principle. For it being that which ſhould haue bene proued / M. Doctor taketh it for graunted. And in diuers places ſpeaking of the archbyſhop / he goeth about to deceiue his reader with the fallation of the <hi>aequiuocation,</hi> or diuers ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word. For whatſoeuer he findeth ſayd of archbyſhop &amp; byſhop in times paſt / he bringeth to eſtabliſhe our archbyſhops and biſhops: when notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding thoſe in times paſt / were much different from oures / and are not of that kynde / as ſhall appeare afterwarde.</p>
               <p>In the. 239. page he reaſoneth / that for ſo muche as thoſe which weare the apparell / do edifie / therefore they edify by reaſon of the apparell / which is to make that the cauſe / which is not / but only commeth wyth the cauſe.</p>
               <p>In the. 240. page he reaſoneth thus / that the ſurplice. &amp;c. be notes / and notes of good miniſters / therefore they be good notes of miniſters / which is a fallacion of compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / when a man thinketh that whatſoeuer is ſayd of a thing by it ſelfe / may be ſayd of it when it is ioyned with an other.</p>
               <p>In the. 149. page he reaſoneth thus / thoſe which authoriſed the booke of Common prayer / were ſtudious of peace / &amp; building the churche / therefore thoſe which finde fault with it / are pullers downe of the church / and diſturbers of the peace / which is a fallacion of the <hi>Accident,</hi> when a man thinketh that euery thing which is verified of the <hi>Subiect,</hi> may be likewiſe verefied of that which is annexed vnto it. The further confutation of which arguments I refer vnto their places.</p>
               <p>There be diuers other which he hath / which are ſo farre from iuſt concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons / as they haue not ſo muche as any colour of likelyhode of argument / which I can not tell where to lodge / vnles I put them in the common Inne / which is that / which is called the ignorance of the <hi>Elench.</hi> as in the. 69. page / when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth thus / that Cyprian ſpeaketh not of the biſhop of Rome / <hi>ergo</hi> he ſpeaketh of an archbyſhop.</p>
               <p>And in the. 71. page. There muſt be ſuperioures / <hi>ergo,</hi> one miniſter muſt be ſuperiour vnto an other. There muſt be degrees / therfore there muſt be one arch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>byſhop ouer a prouince.</p>
               <p>And in the. 73. there was one ouer euery congregation / therefore there was one ouer all the miniſters in the prouince. Theſe / and a number like vnto theſe / M. Doctor hath ſcattered throughout his boke / which as Nero ſayd of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Senecas works / cleaue together like ſand / &amp; thus let it be ſene / whoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are moſt iuſtly concluded / thoſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> admonition / or theſe of M.

If you be / your controuerſy is not ſo much wyth vs / as wyth the byſhops / whych both call miniſters / and excommunicate.

               <p>To come therfore vnto the matter / out of the places of the. 20. of Mathew / and the 22. of Luke where our ſauiour Chriſt / vpon occaſion of the inordinate requeſt of the ſonnes of Zebede / putteth a difference / betwene the ciuill and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall function / he placeth the diſtinction of them in two poyntes / whereof the one is / in their office / the other is in their names and titles.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction of the office he noteth / in theſe words / the kings of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles haue dominion ouer them / and the princes exerciſe authoritie ouer them / but it ſhal not be ſo with you. Wherupon the argument may be thus gathered. That / wherein the ciuill magiſtrate is ſeuered from the eccleſiaſticall officer / doth not agree to one miniſter ouer an other. But the ciuill magiſtrate is ſeuered from the eccleſiaſticall officer / by bearing dominion. Therfore bearing dominion doth not agree to one miniſter ouer an other.</p>
               <p>Touching their names and titles / he putteth a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in theſe words. And they are called gracious Lordes / but it ſhall not be ſo with you. And ſo the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be framed as before / that for as muche as they are ſeuered in titles / and that to the ciuill miniſter doth agree the title of gracious Lordes / therefore to the Eccleſiaſticall miniſter the ſame doth not agree. For as it is fitte / that they whoſe offices cary an outward maieſtie and pompe ſhould haue names agreeable to their magnificence: ſo is it meete / that thoſe that God hath remoued from that pompe and outwarde ſhew / ſhoulde likewiſe be remoued from ſuch ſwelling and loftie titles / as doe not agree with the ſimplicitie of the miniſterie whiche they exerciſe. And whereas it myght ſeeme ſomewhat vniuſte: that he that hath the greater giftes / ſhoulde not be preferred to thoſe which haue leſſe / our ſauioure Chriſt ſheweth that the matter is farre otherwiſe. For by how much euery man doth excell his fellow in the giftes of the holy ghoſt / by ſo muche more / he oughte to employ him ſelfe to the benefite of others: ſo that in a maner he ſhould become (as it were) their ſeruaunt to doe them good. Which although it be in part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the ciuill magiſtrate with the miniſter of the word / yet he doth neuer let downe him ſelfe ſo low / nor geueth his ſeruice either to the church or common wealth / but that he doth and ought in that ſeruice to retayne that dignitie and countenaunce / with the markes and notes thereof / which hys princely eſtate doth require.</p>
               <p>In the end / he propoundeth him ſelfe for example / in whome he ſetteth before their eyes / a perfect paterne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſterie. For ſeeing he being Lord / tooke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to be a ſeruaunt / &amp; being Emperor and king of heauen &amp; earth / was conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to want all the glory &amp; ſhew of the world (his miniſterie ſo requiring) it ſhoulde be great ſhame for them which were his diſciples / choſen out for the miniſtery / not to content them ſelues / but to aſpire vnto ſuch offices and dignities / as they drea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med of.</p>
               <p>Agaynſt thys is ſayde / that the places do nothing elſe but condemne ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſire and tyrannicall vſage of authoritie / and doth not barre the miniſters of theſe thinges.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:21261:14"/>
               <p> Then be like all thoſe godly and learned men / which haue vſed theſe places <note place="margin">* The byſhop of Salſbury ſo alleageth this place in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie againſt maiſter Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. pag. 653.</note> to proue that the Pope which profeſſeth him ſelfe to be an eccleſiaſticall perſon / ought not to haue the ciuill ſworde / nor to vſurpe vnto him ſelfe ſuche glorious pompe / haue abuſed them. For you teach him how he ſhould anſwere / that there is nothing forbidden but ambition and tyrannie / and in deede this is the anſwere of all the Papiſts to that obiection.</p>
               <p>But Muſculus a learned man is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgement. And M. Caluin (as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as he with diuers other) are of that iudgement that I haue alleaged. This is no great proofe of your ſide / nor reproofe of ours / let vs therefore ſee the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherewith this expoſition is warranted. Muſculus reaſon is this / that if he ſhould haue ment that the Apoſtles had bene equall and none greater then an other / then there ſhould be equalitie of all / and none ſhould haue authoritie ouer other. And ſo there ſhoulde be no degrees of the Prince and ſubiect in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth / of maſter and ſeruaunt in a familie / of people &amp; miniſter in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church. But it is no good reaſon to ſay / there is / nor ought to be / any inequalitie amongſt the apoſtles / therefore there is none / nor ought to be none at al: Or to ſay there is no mequalitie amongſt the paſtors / therefore there is no inequalitie betwene the paſtors and the people. For as common wealthes / families / and churches / are preſerued by inequalitie / and in that ſome are higher / and ſome are lower / ſome rule / and ſome obey: ſo are the ſame likewiſe preſerued by equalitie of certayne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them ſelues. As for example / albeit the Conſuls in Rome / wer aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offices / and the people / yet were they equall betwene them ſelues. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be the preſeruation of the family / that the maſter ſhould be aboue the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt / and the father aboue the ſonne: yet it tendeth alſo to the quiet of the houſe that the ſeruaunts amongſt them ſelues / and the brethren amongſt them ſelues / ſhould be equall. And ſo we graunt / that for the preſeruation of the church / it is neceſſary that there be ſome ſhould beare rule / and other ſhould be vnder their rule: but I deny / that thereof followeth / that one miniſter ſhould beare rule ouer an other. Whereas M. Muſculus ſayth that Peter was found in many places chefe amongſt the reſt / if he meane as <hi>Euſebius, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. doth / which ſayth / that he was <hi>tes aretes eneka tôn Ioipon apoſtolon proegoron</hi> for his vertues and gifts he had / one that ſpake before the reſt / &amp; in the name of the reſt / (which he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to do in that he doth not abſolutely geue any chefetie vnto him but only in certayne places) I agree with him / and do not deny / but ſuch chiefetie may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the miniſters / as ſhall appeare more at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>This interpretation of M. Muſculus (maſter D. ſayth) muſte needes be true / or elſe Chriſt ſhould reiect Princes &amp; Magiſtrates / emongſt both Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans &amp; other. I haue ſhewed how it doth not follow that / becauſe he forbiddeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rule vnto the miniſters / therfore he forbiddeth it ſimply and altogether: no more then the law which forbiddeth that any ſtranger ſhould be king of the realme / for biddeth therefore that there ſhoulde be no king of the realme. VVhereas you ſay maiſter Muſculus teacheth how he ought to rule which ruleth / &amp; what he ought to be / I haue tolde you before / other thinke otherwiſe: and therefore you hauing ſette downe hys iudgement before / needed not to haue repeated it here agayne. But the Greeke wordes (you ſay) <hi>catakyrieuouſin kai catexouſiazouſin</hi> doe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to rule wyth oppreſſion / and why may not I ſaye that thys prepoſition <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> doth not ſignifie heere a peruerſneſſe of rule / but an abſoluteneſſe and a full power and iuriſdiction as <hi>catamathein, catalambanein</hi> is not to learne / or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue euilly and peruerſly / but to learne exactly / and to perceiue throughly and perfectly? but what neede we to followe coniectures in ſo playne a matter? when as Saint Luke vſeth the ſimple wordes without any compoſition of <hi>exouſiazein Kai Kyrieuein?</hi> doe you not perceyue that the prepoſition wherein you put ſo great confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / deceiueth you / beſides the manifeſt vntruth you commit in ſaying / that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21261:15"/> all three Euangeliſtes haue <hi>katexouſiazouſin &amp; katakyrieuouſin.</hi> Furthermore you ſay / that our ſauioure Chriſt ſayeth not / that no man ſhall be great amongſt them / but he that deſireth to be great amongſt them. He had ſayd ſo before when he had ſayd it ſhall not be ſo amongſt you / and therefore needed not to repeate it: and yet an other Euangeliſt ſayeth not / he that deſireth to be great / but let the <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 26.</note> greateſt among you / be as the leaſt. VVherby he doth not reprehend only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of being great / but will not haue them to be one aboue an other.</p>

                  <p>Laſt of all you conclude that our ſauiour Chriſt in the 20. of Mathew / re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth the ambition of the ſonnes of zebede / and in the 22. of S. Luke all the reſt of the Apoſtles. I graunte you / he dothe ſo / and that coulde not be done better / then in tellyng them / that they deſired things not meete for them / and which woulde not ſtande with their calling. And if as you ſay the ambition only was reprehended / and the deſire of rule to oppreſſe others wyth / the anſwere you attribute to our ſauioure is not ſo fitte. For they myght haue replyed and ſayde that he forbad tyrannicall rule and oppreſſion of their inferioures / but they deſired that which was a moderate and well ruled gouernment. And ſemeth it vnto you a probable thing / that S. Luke meaneth tyrantes and oppreſſors / when as he ſayth / they are called beneficiall or gracious Lordes? men doe not vſe to call op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors / liberall or bountifull Lordes. Neyther is it to be thought of all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles / that they deſired rule one ouer an other / to the ende that they would vſe crueltie / or tyrannie / or oppreſſion / one ouer an other: for that were to doe them great iniurie. Beſides that it is ſayde / that the reſt of the diſciples diſdayned at the two brethren / whyche they would not haue done / if they had had any purpoſe or mynde to haue oppreſſed them. For then they would haue contemned them / rather then haue diſdayned them / if they had broken out into ſuche groſe faultes. For Ariſtotle teacheth that <hi>nemeſis</hi> (which is the ſame that <hi>aganacteſis</hi> is / the <note place="margin">In hys rethor. ad Theod.</note> verbe whereof the Euangeliſt vſeth) is agaynſt thoſe / that are ſuppoſed of them that beare the diſdayne / to be lifted vp higher and into better eſtate then they are worthy of: whych agreeth wyth that interpretation whyche I haue alleaged / and can not agree wyth the other / whych you ſet downe. For who (ſpeaking properly) would ſpeake after thys ſort. The reſidue of the Apoſtles diſdayned at the two brethren / or thought them vnworthy that they ſhould beare tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call rule ouer them.</p>

Chap. 2.</note> Mathew / where / by the chaire of Moſes our ſauioure Chriſt meaning the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Moſes / doth alſo declare the manner which they vſed in teaching: Of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the communion (which the Euangeliſt noteth to haue bene done of our <note place="margin">Math. 26. 20.</note> Sauioure Chriſt with his diſciples) which examples are not to be lightly chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged / and vppon many occaſions.</p>
               <p>But this I can not omitte / that you make it an indifferent thing to preache the word of God in churches or in houſes / that is to ſay / priuately or publikely. For what better interpretation can I haue / then of your owne wordes / which ſay by and by after / of Baptiſme / that it is at the order of the church / to make it priuate or publike. For if it be in the power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church / to order that Baptiſme may be miniſtred at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of euery priuate perſon / it is alſo in her power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne that the worde / be preached alſo priuately. And then where is that which Salomon ſayth that wyſdom cryeth openly &amp; in the ſtreates / and at the corners <note place="margin">8. Prou. 2. 3.</note> of the ſtretes where many meete: and where be the examples of the olde church / which had beſydes the temple at Ieruſalem / erected vppe ſynagogues in euery towne to heare the worde of God / and myniſter the cyrcumcyſion? what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the commaundement of our ſauioure Chriſt / whych * wylled his diſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <note place="margin">10.

Ioh. 20.</note> and other dyſorders / ſayd that he preached openly in the temple and in the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues / albeit the ſame were very daungerous vnto hym? &amp; the example of the <note place="margin">3. Act. 1. 4. Act. 1.</note> * Apoſtles / that dyd the ſame. For as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of perſecution / when the church
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21261:17"/> dare not / nor is not meete / that it ſhould ſhewe it ſelfe to the ennemy / no not then is the word of God nor the ſacraments priuately preached or miniſtred / neyther yet ought to be.</p>
               <p>For althoughe they be done in the houſe of priuate man / yet becauſe they are &amp; ought to be miniſtred in the preſence of the congregation / there is neyther priuate preaching / nor priuate baptiſme. For like as where ſo euer the Queenes maieſtie lyeth / there is the Courte / althoughe it be in a Gentleman hys houſe / ſo whereſoeuer the churche meeteth / that place is not to be holden priuate / as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the prayers / preachings / and ſacraments / that ſhalbe there miniſtred. So that I denye vnto you that the churche hathe power to ordaine at her pleaſure / whether preaching or miniſtring of ſacramentes / ſhould be priuate or publicke / when they ought not to be / but where the church is / and the church ought not to aſſemble (if it be not letted by perſecution) but in open places. And when it is driuen from them / thoſe places where it gathereth it ſelfe togither / although they be otherwiſe priuate / yet are they for the time that the churches doe there aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble / and for reſpect of the worde and ſacraments / that are there miniſtred in the preſence of the church / publike places. And ſo you ſee thoſe (whome you charge ſlaunderouſly wyth conuenticles) are faine to glaſe vp the windowes that you open to ſecreate and priuate conuenticles.</p>

               <p>And marke I pray you whether your affections cary you: before you ſayd / that the Lords day which was vſed for the day of reſt in the Apoſtles time / may be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged / as the place / and houre of prayer: but the day of the paſſion &amp; reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. &amp;c. you either thruſt vpon vs as the decree of the apoſtles / or at leaſt put vpon vs a neceſſity of keping of them / leaſt haply in breaking of them / we might breake the Apoſtles decree / for you make it to lie betweene the councels and the apoſtles / which of them decreed this.

               <p>And as for thoſe three rules / whych you ſaye / are worthye to be noted / I can ſee nothing that they helpe your cauſe one whit / for I knowe no man that euer denyed / but that the churche may in ſuche things as are not ſpecified / and preciſely determined / make orders ſo they be grounded of thoſe generall rules whych I haue before alledged out of S.

               <p>And as for the ſecond of the three rules / I can not at any hand allow it.

Peter Martyr were neuer printed (as I can not vnderſtand they were) then beſides that you do vs iniurie / whych go about to preiudice our cauſe by the teſtimonies of them / which we can neither heare / nor ſee / being kept cloſe in your ſtudy: you
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21261:20"/> alſo do your cauſe much more iniurie / whileſt you betray the pouerty and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it / being faine to ranſake &amp; rifie vp euery darke corner / to finde ſome thing to couer it with. Therefore it were good / before you toke any benefite of them / to let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come forth / and ſpeake their owne teſtimonies in their owne language and ful out. For now you geue men occaſion to thinke / that there are ſome other things in their Epiſtles / whych you would be lothe the world ſhould know / for feare of fall of that / which you would gladly keepe.</p>
               <p>There is no man that fayth / that it ought to be permitted to euery perſon in the church where he is miniſter / to haue ſuch order or diſcipline / or to vſe ſuch ſeruice / as he liſteth / no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeketh for it. But to haue the order which God hath left in thoſe things which the word preciſely appoynteth / and in other thyngs to vſe that / whych ſhall be according to the rules of S. Paule before recited / agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the church / and conſtrined by the Prince.</p>
               <p>And whereas you haue euer hitherto geuen the ordering of theſe thyngs to the churche / howe come you nowe to aſcribe it to the Biſhops? you meane I am ſure the Biſhops / as we call Biſhops heere in England / whereby you fall into the opinion of the papiſts vnwares / which when they haue ſpoken many things of the churche magnifically / at the laſt they bring it nowe to the Doctors of the church / nowe to byſhops.</p>
               <p>As forme / although I doute not but there be many good men of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes / and very learned alſo / and therfore very meete to be admitted into that conſultation / wherin it ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered / what things are good in the church: yet in reſpect of that office and calling of a biſhop / which they now exerciſe / I thinke that euery godly learned miniſter &amp; paſtor of the churche / hath more intereſt and right in reſpect of his office / to be at that conſultation / then any biſhop or arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop in the realme / for as muche as he hath an ordinarie calling of God &amp; func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appoynted in the ſcriptures which he exerciſeth / and the other hath not.</p>
               <p>But how thys authoritie pertaining to the whole church of making of ſuch orders / may and ought to be called to a certaine number / that confuſion may be auoyded / and wyth the conſent alſo of the churches to auoyde tyrannie / it ſhall appeare in a more proper place / where we ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip or gouernment in euery churche / and of the communion and ſocietie or participation and entercommuning of the churches togither / by councels and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies prouinciall or nationall.</p>

For ſurely / if theſe two places agree not vnto vs in time of the goſpell / I knowe none in all the olde Teſtament / whych doe agree / and I praye you what is heere ſayde / whych S.

               <p>Then you are driuen to ſaye / that the Iewes vnder the lawe / had a more certaine direction / and conſequently a readyer waye / then we haue in the time of the goſpell / of the whych time the Prophet ſayeth / that then a man ſhoulde not <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 34.</note> teache his neighbor / they ſhalbe ſo taught of God: as if he ſhould ſay / that they that liue vnder the goſpel / ſhould be all in compariſon of that whych were vnder the lawe Doctors.

               <p>Now if the Iewes had precepts of euery the leaſt action / whych told them preciſely how they ſhould walke: how is not their caſe in that poynt better then oures / whych becauſe we haue in many things but generall rules / are to ſeeke oftentimes / what is the will of God whych we ſhould follow?

               <p>To the ordering and gouerning of the church / they had only the moral and ceremoniall law: we haue the ſame morall that they had: what ſpeciall direction therfore they enioy by the benefite of that / we haue. We haue no ceremonies but two / the ceremonies or ſacraments of Baptiſme and of the Lords ſupper / &amp; we haue as certaine a direction to celebrate them / as they had / to celebrate their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies / and fewer and les difficulties can riſe of oures / then of theirs: and we haue more plaine and expres doctrine to decide our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies then they had for theirs. What houre had they for their ordinarie and daily ſacrifices: was it not left to the order of the church? what places were apointed in their ſeuerall dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to heare the woorde of God preached continually / when they came not to Ieruſalem? the word was commaunded to be preached / but no mention made / what manner of place they ſhould haue: where was pulpittes commaunded / or chaires? and yet they had both. Where any forme of buriall in the law? and yet it is a thing pertaining to the church / that the deade be after a comely ſorte buried. Where / any order or forme of mariage? and yet it is knowne they had. It was (whych is more) in the diſcretion of that churche / vppon occaſion of dearthe / or warre / plagues / or any other common calamitie / to proclaime a faſte.</p>
               <p>I wil not be long / where as you ſay / that they had nothing but was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the law: and we haue many things vndetermined and left to the order of the churche / I will offer for one that you ſhall bring / that we haue left to the order of the church / to ſhew you that they had twentie whych were vndecided of by the expres word of God.

               <p>And as for the iudiciall lawe / for as muche as there are ſome of them made in regarde of the region where they were geuen / and of the people to whom they were giuen / the Prince and Magiſtrate keping the ſubſtance &amp; equitie of them
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21261:21"/> (as it were the marrow) may chaunge the circumſtances of them / as the times / and places / and manners of the people ſhall require. But to ſay that any magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate can ſaue the life of blaſphemers / contemptuous and ſtubborne Idolaters / murderers / adulterers / inceſtuous perſons / and ſuche like / whych God by hys iudiciall lawe hath commaunded to be put to death / I doe vtterly denye / and am ready to proue / if that pertained to thys queſtion. And therfore althoughe the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall lawes are permitted to the diſcretion of the prince and magiſtrate / yet not ſo generally as you ſeeme to affirme / and as I haue oftentimes ſayde / that not only it muſt not be done againſt the word / but according to the worde and by it.</p>
               <p>After you define what is it to take from / &amp; put to the word of God / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not to ſpeake of your wonderfull dexteritie in defining / whych can define two things / and thoſe contrary (putting to and taking fro) with one differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (which zeno him ſelfe could neuer do) you leaue out that whych Moſes eſpecially meant to comprehend / whych is / not to do more / nor to do les / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. And as for your deuiſion / it hath as euil ſucces here / as in other places / for when it is a great fault in deuiding / to haue eyther too muche or too little / you faulte in bothe / for whereas you ſay / they adde / whych teache or decree. &amp;c. beſides that you leaue out whych Moſes ment / you forget alſo that whych your ſelfe hadde ſayd / which had placed adding to / not only in teaching and decreeing / but in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or beleeuing. And wheras you make foure partes of your deuiſion / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three laſt are found to be all vnder the firſt member / whych is to make things of fayth and ceremonies / contrary to the worde / and ſo your deuiſion is not only faultye / but no diuiſion at all. The whych thing I could haue eaſely forgeuen you / and paſſed by as a thing not very commendable to trauaile to ſhewe the pouertye of thoſe things / whych doe ſufficiently of them ſelues (as it were) proclaime their owne ſhame: but that it greeued me to ſee a boke lengthened wyth firſt / ſecond / thirde / laſt / as thoughe euery one of them contained ſome notable newe matter / whych needed an Oyes before it / to ſtirre vp the attention of the reader / when there is nothing but a many of words wythout matter / as it were a ſort of faire emptie Apothecaries boxes / wythout any ſtuffe in them. And for that you are ſo hard wyth other men for their Logike / I will deſire the reader to pardone me / if I purſue theſe things more narowlyer then ſome peraduenture will lyke of / or I my ſelfe delight in.

S.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21261:21"/> Apoſtles in the church of Corinth / becauſe they preached the word vntruely / but becauſe they vſing paynted wordes and affected eloquence / and making a great ſhew of learning and tounges / dyd not preache the Goſpell ſincerely. So that you ſee that it is one thing not to preache truely / and an other not to preache purely: and you ſee their reaſon is not ſo euill: for the want of a good calling / may geue occaſion to ſay / that the word of God is not ſincerely taught / becauſe there is not a lawful and ordynary calling. For although for the ſubſtance of doctryne / and the manner of handling of it / they that S. Paul ſpeaketh of to the Phillip. dyd no fault / yet S.

Therefore let men iudge how iuſt your waights are / that expounde not purely / not truely: and whether thys be to confute other mens arguments / rather then to ſkirmiſhe wyth your owne ſhadowes.</p>
               <p>I know no papiſtes reaſon thus / that becauſe we haue no miniſters / therfore no word / no ſacraments / no diſciplyne / no church.

For in ſaying that the face of the church doth not ſo much appeare (for ſo the whole proces of their booke doth declare that they meane / when they ſay that we haue not ſcarſe the face of the church) they graunt / that we haue the church of God: but that for want of thoſe ornaments / which it ſhuld haue / and through certayne the deformed ragges of poperie which it ſhould not haue / the churche doth not appeare in her natiue colours / and ſo beautifull / as it is meete ſhe ſhould be prepared to ſo glorious a huſband as is the ſonne of God.

               <p>Beſides that / albeit thoſe two Mathyas and Barſabas were therefore ſet vp in the myddeſt / that the church in the prayer that was made for their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / myghte / by ſeeing them / pray the earneſtlyer for them: yet it was alſo as much to ſay / that if any could obiect any thing agaynſt them / that he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre hys obiection.</p>

               <p>And although there be certayne thinges extraordinary in this election / as / that ſuch a one muſt be choſen which hadde bene conuerſant with our fauioure Chriſt / and that there were two put vp for one place / and that it was permitted to lottes / to caſt the Apoſtleſhip vpon one of them two / as if the Lord ſhould by the lottes from heauen / tell / who ſhould haue it: yet it followeth not to ſay / that the reſt of the things that are there vſed / ſhould not be practiſed in ordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges / for as much as they will well agree with them.</p>
               <p>And M.

For conſydering of the one parte the greatneſſe of the charge that is committed vnto the myniſters / and the horrible pearill that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto the church by the want of thoſe thinges that are required in them and of the other parte wrighing the weakeneſſe of the nature of man / which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe he ſeeth many thinges yet hee is blynde alſo in many / and that euen in thoſe thinges which he ſeeth / he ſuffereth hym ſelfe to be caryed away by his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of loue or of enuie. &amp;c.

               <p>Secondarely / I cannot commend it / for that / that one man is the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con / which muſt examyne the paſtors / and iudge of their ſufficiencie. For what is the Archdeacon? is he not a Deacon? for he being the cheefe Deacon / muſt needes be alſo a Deacon hym ſelfe. And therfore although the cheefe deacon / yet inferioure to any of the paſtoures: and the * giftes which are required in hym / in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferioure <note place="margin">1.

And to make him iudge of the aptneſſe &amp; ableneſſe of the paſtoure / is to make the inferioure in giftes / iudge of the ſuperioure: he that hath by hys calling leſſe giftes / iudge of his which hath by his calling greater giftes / which is nothing elſe / then to appoynt him that hath but one eye / to ouerſee hys ſight / that hath two.</p>
               <p>Thirdly / I miſtyke the booke / becauſe it permitteth that the Biſhop may admit the miniſter / vpon the credite and report of the Archdeacon / &amp; vpon his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination / if there be no oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people: which appeareth by theſe words in the booke / whereas to the Archdeacon ſaying thus. <hi>Reuerend father in God.

               <p>The Lord bleſſe and encreaſe an hundreth folde the godly / wiſe / learned / graue miniſters of thys churche.

               <p>WHat ought to be generall / if thys ought not / to put the miniſter that hathe bene an idolater / from hys myniſterie? is it not a commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of God / and geuen / not of one Leuite or two / but of all thoſe that went backe / not at one tyme / but at others alſo / when the like occaſion was geuen / as appeareth in the booke of Kings / where all the prieſtes of the Lord that had ſacrificed in the <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21261:23"/> blameleſſe. I thinke if ſo be a man had bene knowne to be an adulterer / although he repented him / yet none that is well aduiſed / would take him into the miniſterie. For if S. Paul reiect him that had ij. wyues at once (which was a thing that the Iewes and Gentiles thought lawfull / and that was common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them / and had preuayled throughout all the world) how much les would he ſuffer any to be admitted to the miniſterie / which ſhould be an adulterer / and haue an other mans wyfe / which is condemned of all that profeſſe the name of Chriſt / and which is not ſo generall a miſcheefe as that was: Or would he ſuffer him to abyde in the miniſterie / which ſhould commit ſuch wickednes during his function / lykewyſe of a murtherer. Now the ſinne of Idolatry is greater &amp; more deteſtable / then any of them / in as much as pertayning to the firſt table / it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ſtayneth Gods honor / and breaketh duetie to him / vnto whom we more owe it (without all compariſon) then to any mortall man. And if S. Paul in the choyſe of the widow / to attende vpon the ſicke of the church / which was the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt office in the church / requireth not only ſuch a one as is at the time of the choiſe / honeſt and holy / but ſuch a one as hath led her whole life in all good workes / and with commendation / how much more is that to be obſerued in the miniſter or byſhop of the church / that he be not only at the tyme of his choyſe / but all other times before ſuch a one / as hath lyued without any notable / and open offence of thoſe / amongſt whome he had his conuerſation.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould ſtand with you / whether Peter his forſwearing that he knew not Chriſt / were a greater fault then to go from the goſpell to idolatrie / and there in / for ſome long ſpace to continue / as the Leuites dyd / I ſhoulde trouble you. For if a man / ſodenly and at a puſh / for feare / and to ſaue his life / ſay and ſweare he is no chriſtian / and the ſame day repent him of hys fault / although it be a great and haynous cryme / yet it ſeemeth not to be ſo great / as his is / which not only denyeth Chriſt in words / but doth it alſo in deedes / and worſhippeth Antichriſt / and continueth in that worſhip / not a day / but moneths / and yeares.</p>
               <p>But I wil anſwere you / that euen as our ſauiour Chriſt called S. Paule in the heate of his perſecution / &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was a blaſphemer vnto the Apoſtleſhip / ſo he hauing the law in his owne handes / and making no lawes for him ſelfe / but for vs / might call S. Peter alſo to that function / which had thriſe denyed him.</p>
               <p>But as it is not lawfull for vs / to follow the example of Chriſt in calling of Paul / by admitting thoſe which are new conuerted / hauing a contrary precept geuen / that no * new plant / or greene chriſtian / ſhould be taken to the myniſterie: <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 6.</note> So is it not lawfull / to follow that example of our ſauiour Chriſt / the contrary being commaunded / as I haue before alledged. For albeit the examples of our ſauiour Chriſt be to be followed of vs / yet if there be commaundementes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to the contrary / then we muſt know / that it is our partes to walke in the broade and beaten way / as it were the common cauſſie of the commaundement / rather then an outpathe of the example.</p>
               <p>I know Ambroſe was taken newly from Paganiſme / to be biſhop of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine / for the great eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; credite he had amongſt the people / but beſides that I haue ſhewed / that ſuche thinges are vnlawfull being forbidden. The errors and corrupt expounding of ſcriptures / which are founde in his workes / declare that it had bene more ſafe for the churche / if by ſtudie of the ſcriptures / he hadde firſt bene a ſcholer of dyuinitie / or euer he hadde beene made doctor. There may be more examples ſhewed out of that / which you call the prymitiue churche / to the contrary of that which you ſay. For when they vſed often tymes agaynſte thoſe that hadde ſo falne ſuche ſeueritie (in deede extreme and exceſſiue) that they were neuer after / vntill their deathes admitted to the Lordes table: I leaue to you to thinke / whether they woulde then ſuffer any ſuche to execute the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">1. <hi>Lib.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21261:24"/> thys / that thoſe that haue ſacrificed to idolles / ſhould not be permitted any more to miniſter in the church. But you aſke what they ſay to M. Luther / Bucer / Crannier / Latimer / Ridley? I pray you when dyd theſe excellent perſonages / euer ſlide from the goſpell vnto idolatrie? which of them dyd euer ſay Maſſe / af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God had opened them the truth? what hath ſo blynded you that you can not diſtinguiſhe and put a difference / betweene one that hauing bene nouſled from hys youthe vp in idolatrie / commeth afterwardes out of it / and betweene hym / which hauing knowledge of the goſpell / afterward departeth from it / and of ſuch is the place of Ezechiel / of ſuch I ſay / as haue gone backe and fallen away.</p>
               <p>I know none / that haue beene preachers of the goſpell / and after in the time of Queene Mary malſemongers / which now are zealous / godly / &amp; learned prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers / and if there be any ſuche / I thincke for offence ſake / the Church might better be without them then haue them. You ſay God in that place ſheweth how greuous a ſinne idolatrie is / in the prieſtes eſpecially. And is it not now more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous in the myniſter of the goſpell / whoſe function is more precious and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge greater? And if the ſinne be greater / ſhould it haue now a leſſe puniſhment / then it had then? how ſhall the fault be eſteemed great or little / but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatnes or ſmalneſſe of the puniſhment? you ſayde before the places of Deuteronomie / touching adding and diminiſhing nothing from that which the Lord commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth / were for the Iewes / and are not for our times. And thys commaundement of God in Ezechiel / you ſay / ſerued for that time / and not for oures.</p>
               <p>You worke a ſure way / which to mayntayne your corruptions / deny the ſcripture / which ſpeaketh agaynſt them / to be vnderſtanded of thoſe which be in our time / and that to be vnderſtanded of our miniſters / which was of theirs / or of our faultes / which was of theirs. Thys is not the way to Anabaptiſme / but to all hereſies / and ſchiſmes / that euer haue bene or ſhall be. For if you goe forwarde in clipping the ſcripture / as you begin / you will leaue vs nothing in the ende / wherewith we may eyther defend our ſelues agaynſt heretikes / or be able to ſtrike at them.</p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay / there is a great difference / betweene the ſeueritie of the law / and lenitie of the goſpell / me thinkes I ſmell a ſpice of the error of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niches / which were alſo ſchollers in that behalfe of the olde hereticke Cerdon / that there is a good and an euill / a gentle and a ſeuere God / one vnder the law / and an other vnder the goſpell. For to ſaye that God was then a ſeuere puny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher of ſinne / and that now he is not at ſo great hatred wyth it / but that he will haue it gentlyer and ſoftlyer dealt with: is euen all one in effect with that / which ſuppoſeth two Goddes. I will ioyne with you in it / that the tranſgreſſyons of the law in the tyme of the goſpell oughte rather to be ſeuerelyer punyſhed / then they were vnder the law / for as muche as the knowledge is greater / and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of the ſpirite of God / whereby the lawes are kept is more plentifull / then vnder the lawe.</p>
               <p>At this tyme I will content me with the place of Zach. which propheſying <note place="margin">13. Chap. 3.</note> of the kingdome of Chriſte / and of the tyme of the goſpell ſayth / that then the father and mother of the falſe Prophet ſhall cauſe theyr owne ſonne to bee put to deathe. It is as abſurde which is brought / to proue that the papiſtes whiche worſhippe God falſly / doe not faulte ſo haynouſly as the Iſraelites dyd / which worſhipped the Idolles. As who ſhoulde ſaye / the Iewes or any other the groſſeſt idolaters that euer were / dyd euer take thoſe thinges which they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped / Serpentes / Oxen / Fire / Water. &amp;c. to be God / or knew not the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages before which they fell downe / were Woode or Stone / Siluer and Gold. And who knoweth not / that they thought that they worſhipped by them and in them / the God which made heauen &amp; earth. The Iewes when they molted a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> calfe / and fell downe before it / did neuer thinke that to be God / * but ſayde
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21261:24"/> that they wold kepe holy day to the Lord <hi>Iehouah.</hi> Wherein I will put you ouer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> learned treatiſes of the godly new wryters / which do refute this diſtinction being brought of the papiſtes / as a ſhift to proue that the Idolatrie which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the olde Teſtament / toucheth not them / becauſe they worſhip God by theſe things / and the idolatrous Iewes and infidels / worſhipped nothing elſe / nor loked at nothing elſe / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bare things before which they fell down. Which ſelfe ſame diſtinction you bring to proue / that papiſtrie is not ſo deteſtable / as the idolatrie of the Iewes. It may be / that certayne of the Gentiles worſhipped by their images / Iupiter and Iuno. &amp;c. but you can not ſhew / that the Iſraelites euer worſhipped any other God / then the true God / ſo that their fault was only / in that they worſhipped him otherwiſe / then he had appoynted. And the Gentiles that worſhipped many Gods / worſhipped one as the head and cheefe / and the reſt as ſmall companions / and as they termed them / <hi>minorum gentium deos,</hi> as the papiſtes doe God as the cheefe / and the ſainctes as other petie gods.</p>
               <p>And here all men may ſee / what a good proctor you be for the papiſtes / bothe in leſtning their faultes / and abating their puniſhments / and yet will not I ſaye / that you are conſpired with them / or haue receiued your ſee of them. But if you can ſhew where / or in what one poynt / thoſe that you charge with confederacie / haue layde ſo ſofte pillowes vnder their heades as theſe are: they refuſe not to be called confederate and conſpired with the papiſtes.</p>

               <p>WHat ſhould become of the people in the meane ſeaſon / whileſt they learne their Catechiſme / and when they haue learned it / they are no more fitte to be Miniſters and to teach other / then he that hath learned his Accidence / is meete to ſet vp a ſchole. And it can not be defended / but it was a groſſe ouer ſight / to enioyne miniſters to learne a Catechiſme. It were much to compel them to read it. And if a man would haue declamed agaynſt the ignoraunce of the moſt part of the miniſters / three whole dayes together / he could not haue ſayde more againſt them / then that Canon which ſendeth them to their A.

But how ſiender a reaſon that is / it may be conſidered of infinite places in the ſcripture / whereof I will recite two or three.</p>
               <p>In the fifthe Chapter of Ioſua it is ſayde / that Ioſua made him ſharpe <note place="margin">Chap. 5. 3.</note> kniues for the circumciſing of the children of Iſraell / and a little after that Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua circumciſed them.

               <p>In Exodus / it is ſayde / that Moſes dyd appoynt vnto the people / Princes / <note place="margin">Chap. 18. 25.</note> Captaynes ouer thouſandes and hundrethes. &amp;c. And if any conclude thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon / that hee dyd it him ſelfe alone / hee is by and by confuted by that whiche is wrytten in Deuteronomie / where it appeareth / that the people dyd chuſe <note place="margin">1.

               <p>To come to the newe Teſtament: In the Actes it is ſayde that Paule and <note place="margin">16.

Act. 23.</note> and directors of that action.</p>
               <p>The ſame manner of ſpeach is vſed of the Romane ſtories / wherein it is ſayd that the Conſull dyd make Magiſtrates / for becauſe that he gathered the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and voyces whereby they were made: and ſo S.

Firſt / where you ſay that ſome tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath / that they ordained miniſters wythout making mention of election / what haue you gained therby / when I can ſhew mo that tranſlate it otherwiſe / and ſay it is that they ordained by election / or voices / or ſuffrages? I had not the commoditye of bookes / wherby I coulde ſee the iudgement of all Eccleſiaſticall wryters. But of thoſe whych I had / I finde that there was but one only M.

If ſo be that the holy ghuſt had ment the ſolemne putting on of the handes vpon the heades of him that was created elder and miniſter / had he not words enough to vtter this hys meaning? would he haue / for laying on of hands / vſed a word that ſignifieth lifting vp of hands? would he haue vſed a word ſignifying holding vp for laying downe? for when the hands are layd of the head of an other / they are layd downe / and not holden vp. There are words in the olde Teſtament / and in the newe / before S. Luke wrote / and after he wrote / to expres thys ceremony of laying on of hands / and yet none haue euer expreſſed thys.</p>
               <p>S. Paule ſpeaketh thriſe of it in his Epiſtles to Timothe / and alwayes he <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 14. 1. Tim. 5. 22. 2. Tim. 1. 6.</note> vſeth <hi>epitheſis ton cheiron.</hi> In the old Teſtament where thys ceremonie is vſed and ſpoken of / the Septuaginta did neuer tranſlate <hi>cheirotonein.</hi> But as the wryters of the newe Teſtament <hi>epitheſis cheiron.</hi> And what ſhould I ſtande in thys / when as S. Luke him ſelfe / bothe before and after / ſpeaking of that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <note place="margin">8. Actes. 17. 9. Actes. 17. 19. Actes. 6.</note> of laying on of hands / doth neuer vſe this word <hi>cheirotonein,</hi> but the ſame word whych ſ. Paule vſeth / and the Septuaginta? and although the holy ghoſt ſpeake properly and wel by whomſoeuer he ſpeaketh / yet it could haue ben worſt of all ſayd by S. Luke of all the Canonicall wryters / that he ſhould ſpeake thus vnproperly / who of them all wryteth moſte purely and elegantly / according to the phraſe of the moſte eloquent Grecians / and therfore he borowed this ſpeache of the auncient Greeke wryters / whych did vſe to expres their elections by thys worde / becauſe they were made / and voyces geuen / by thys Ceremonie of lifting vp of handes.</p>
               <p>But what if S. Luke haue vſed thys worde before / and in thys booke / in the ſignification of chuſing by voyce / dare you then ſay that he vſeth it heere for putting on of hands? In the Actes / S. Peter ſayeth that Chriſt after hys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection / <note place="margin">10. Chap. 41.</note> appeared not vnto the whole people / but vnto thoſe whom he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore choſen by his voyce to be hys witneſſes / he vſeth thys word <hi>procecheiroto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemenous.</hi> Nowe if you will ſay heere / that it is to be turned / thoſe of whome he layd his handes / I will aſke you where you read that euer he layd his handes of their heads / I will ſhewe you where he did by hys heauenly voyce appoynt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <note place="margin">Math. 28. 19.</note> And I thinke you are not able to ſhew in any Greeke author auncient / &amp; which men do take to be autenticall / to teache the propertie or eloquence of the Greeke tongue / I meane which were before S. Luke his time / where the worde <hi>chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotonein,</hi> is taken for the laying on of hands of the head of any.</p>
               <p>Thys I confeſſe that the Greeke Eccleſiaſticall wryters / haue ſometimes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21261:26"/> vſed it ſo / but you muſte remember that S. Luke coulde not learne to ſpeake of them that came two or three hundreth yeares after him / but he borrowed thys phraſe of ſpeache of thoſe that were before him / and therfore ſpeaketh of elections as they did. So that you ſee thys ſhift will not ſerue.</p>
               <p>Let vs therfore ſee your third: whych is / that although the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent was then required / yet is it not nowe / and that it is no general rule / no more then (ſay you) that all things ſhould be therfore common now / becauſe they were in the Apoſtles time.</p>
               <p>The authors of the Admonition / wyth their fauourers / muſte be counted Anabaptiſts / no one word being ſhewed whych tendeth thervnto / you muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them whych confirme that foundation whereof they build their communitie of all things / whych is one of their cheefe hereſies. If I ſhoulde ſaye nowe that you are like to thoſe that rowe in a boate / whych although they loke backwards / yet they thruſt a nother way / I ſhould ſpeake with more likelihode the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue done. For althoughe you make a countenaunce / and ſpeake hotely againſt Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes / yet in deede you ſtrengthen their handes wyth reaſons. But I will not ſay ſo / neither doe I thinke that you fauoure that ſecte / but only the whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde and tempeſt of your affection bent to maintaine this eſtate / whereby you haue ſo great honoure and wealth / driueth you vpon theſe rocks to wracke your ſelfe on / and others.</p>
               <p>For I pray you what communitie is ſpoken of either in the ſecond / thirde / or fourth of the Actes / whych ought not to be in the church / as long as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world ſtandeth? was there any communitie but as touching the vſe / and ſo farre for the as the pore brethren had neede of / and not to take euery man a like? was it not in any man his power to ſell his houſes or landes / or not to ſell them? When he <note place="margin">1. Actes. 45. 5. Acres. 4.</note> had ſolde them / was it not in euery man his libertie / to keepe the money to hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at his pleaſure? and all they that were of the Church / did not ſell their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions / but thoſe whoſe heartes the Lord touched ſingularly wyth the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the neede of others / and whome God had bleſſed wyth aboundance / that they had to ſerue them ſelues / and helpe others / and therefore it is reckened as a <note place="margin">4. Actes. 36.</note> rare example / that * Barnabas the Cyprian and Leuite did ſel hys poſſeſſions / and brought the price to the feete of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And as for Ananias &amp; Saphira / they were not puniſhed for becauſe they brought not the price of their poſſeſſions to the Apoſtles / but becauſe they lyed / ſaying that they had brought the whole / when they had brought but parte. And to be ſhorte / is there any more done there / then S. Paule preſcribeth to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians / and in them to all churches to the worldes end? After he had exhorted to liberalitie towardes the pore churche in Ieruſalem / not (ſayth he) that other <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 13. 14</note> ſhould be releeued and you oppreſſed / but vpon like condition at this time / your aboundance ſupplieth their lacke / that alſo their aboundance maye be for youre lacke / that there might be equalitie / as it is wrytten / he that gathered much / had nothing ouer / and he that gathered little / had not the les.</p>
               <p>Surely / it were better you were no Doctor in the Churche / then that the Anabaptiſtes ſhould haue ſuche holde to bring in their communitie as you geue them. In ſumme / the Apoſtolike communitie / or the Churches in their time was not Anabaptiſticall.</p>
               <p>Vnto the place of the ſeconde Epiſtle to the Corinthians / and. 8. chapter / you aſke what maketh that to the election of the miniſters / but why doe not you ſay heere / as you did in the other place that the apoſtle meaneth nothing els but the putting on of the handes of them whych ordained / for the ſame worde <hi>chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotonetheis</hi> is heere vſed / that was there / and this place dothe manifeſtly and wythout all contradiction conuince your vaine ſignification that you make of it in the other place / and the vntruthe / ſaying that the ſcripture vſeth thys woorde
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21261:26"/> for a ſolemne manner of ordering miniſters by putting on of handes. For heere it is ſayde that he that was ioyned wyth Paule / was <hi>cheirotonetheis</hi> by the church / and it is manifeſt that the impoſition of hands was not by the church &amp; people / but by the elders and miniſters / as it appeareth in ſ. Paule to Timothe. <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 14. 2. Tim. 1. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now / to come to that which you make ſo light of / for ſay you how foloweth this / the church choſe Luke or Barnabas to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion of Paule his iourney: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the churches muſt chuſe their miniſters?

Paule?</p>
               <p>And if S. Paule woulde haue the authoritye of the churche to ordaine the Miniſter that ſhoulde ayde hym in other places for the gathering of reliefe of the poore Churches / howe muche more did he thincke it meete / that the Churches ſhoulde chuſe their owne Miniſter / whych ſhould gouerne them. Which things may be alſo ſayde of the election in the firſt of the Actes: for there the Churche firſte choſe two / whereof one ſhoulde be an Apoſtle / whych ſhoulde not be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of that Church / but ſhould be ſent into all the world. So that alwayes the Apoſtles haue ſhunned to do any thing of their owne willes / without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge eyther of thoſe churches where they inſtituted any gouernors: or if it were for the behofe of thoſe places where there were no churches gathered / yet would they ordaine none / but by the conſent of ſome other churche / whych was already eſtabliſhed. You will not deny / but that in the Apoſtles time / and S. Cyprians time in many places the conſent of the people was required / ſhewe any one place where it was not?</p>
               <p>Dothe not S. Luke ſay / that it was done churche by churche / that is in euery churche? And where you ſay it endured but to S.

If it were a priuate example of one / or in one place alone / or if it were countermaunded by any other rule of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture / then the example were not alwayes ſafe to follow. But what if there bee commaundement alſo?</p>
               <p>In the booke of Numbers / the Lorde commaundeth that the Leuites <note place="margin">8. Chap. 10.</note> which preached the word of God to the people in their ſeuerall congregations ſhoulde be brought before the Lorde and before the people / and the people ſhould lay theyr handes vppon the Leuites heades: which / what other thing is it / then to declare their lyking of them / and by that ceremony to conſecrate them / and ſet them aparte for that vſe of their miniſterie? And if you ſay that it were a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order that all ſhoulde lay on their handes / I graunt you: but ſo he ſpeaketh / becauſe the approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was by all / and ſome in the name of the reſt declared that / by their laying on of handes.</p>
               <p>But me thinketh I heare your olde anſwere / that this pertaineth not vnto vs / being a thing done vnder the law: but take heede what you ſay / for if you wil
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21261:27"/> admit neyther the generall examples of the newe Teſtament / nor the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and examples of the Olde / take heede that you do not or euer you be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware / ſpoile vs of the cheefe and principall pillers and buttreſſes of our religion / and bring vs to plaine Catabaptiſtrie / whych you ſay you are ſo afraid of.</p>
               <p>For to proue the Baptiſme of children and yong infantes / what ſtronger holde haue we / then that God commaunded in the old Teſtament / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they ſhould be circumciſed / and examples thereof in the newe Teſtament / for that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles baptiſed whole families / wherby all likelyhode there were children.

Beſides that / in the. 6. of the Actes / the Apoſtles commaund that the church ſhould ſeke them out Deacons / whome they might appoynt ouer the poore.</p>
               <p>Touching certaine Ceremonies / I haue ſhewed that they are neceſſarye: as namely the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>And as for Diſcipline and gouernment / I haue ſhewed partly / and more heereafter will be ſhewed / that they are of the ſubſtance of the goſpell / if to haue Excommunication / be to haue Diſcipline / or if to haue paſtors or Byſhops / and Doctors / and Deacons / be gouernment of the Churche. You ſay / that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the Apoſtles time thys vſe was of hauing the conſent of the church in the choiſe of their paſtor or byſhop / nowe in thys eſtate it were moſte pernicious and hurtfull. Wherin / ſee how vnaduiſedly you condemne the churches of Geneua / of all Fraunce / of certaine of the Germaine churches / which keepe thys order. But you alledge your reaſons / therefore thoſe thoſe are to be conſidered / becauſe they come ſo rare. For your manner is / that if you can haue but one wryter / newe / or olde of your ſide / or whych ſeemeth to be of your ſide? you runne away wyth the matter / as though you had ſcripture / reaſon / doctors / and all.</p>
               <p>I will therefore then take a viewe of your reaſons / when as I ſhall haue breefely ſet downe thoſe reaſons / wherby the perpetuall equitie / reaſonablenes / and conueniencie of thys order / that the church ſhould haue a ſtroke in her mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters election may appeare.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd amongſt the Lawyers / and in deede reaſon / which is the law of all nations / confirmeth it. <hi>Quod omnium intereſt, ab omnibus approbari debet.</hi> That whych ſtandeth all men vpon / ſhould be approued of all men. Which lawe hath this ſenſe / that if it may be / it were good that thoſe things whych ſhall binde all men / and whych require the obedience of all / ſhoulde be concluded as farre as may be / by the conſent of all / or at leaſt by the conſent of as many as may be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And therfore it draweth much the obedience of the ſubiectes of thys realme / that the ſtatutes whereby the realme is gouerned / paſſe by the conſent of the moſte parte of it / whileſt they be made by them / whome the reſt put in truſt / and chuſe for that purpoſe / being as it were all their actes.</p>
               <p>So is it alſo when the queſtion is to chuſe the magiſtrate / Mayor / or bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe / or Conſtable of euery towne / whych things if they haue good groundes in ciuill affaires / they haue much better in Eccleſiaſticall. For it is much more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that there ſhould be thruſt vpon me / a gouernoure of whom the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſaluation or damnation both of my body and ſoule doth depend / then him of whome my wealth and commoditye of thys life doth hang. Onles thoſe vpon whome he were thruſt / were fooles / or madde men / or children / wythout all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of ordering them ſelues / whych as I will ſhewe / can not agree wyth thoſe / that are the church of god / and are to haue a paſtor. For they of the church of God / although they be called ſheepe in reſpect of their ſimplicitye and harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes / yet are they alſo for their circumſpection wiſe as ſerpents / in the wiſdom eſpecially whych is to ſaluation: and how vile accompt ſo euer you wil make of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21261:27"/> of them / they are the people of God / and therfore ſpirituall / and forthwith thoſe of whome S. Paule ſayth / the ſpirituall man diſcerneth all thyngs. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer / reaſon and experience teacheth / that it maketh muche to the profiting of the church vnder the hande of the paſtor or biſhop / that the churche loue him and reuerence him: For the contempt and hatred of the miniſter for the moſt parte / ſtandeth not in hys owne perſon / but reacheth euen vnto the doctrine whych he teacheth. But the miniſter that the churche deſireth / it commonly beſt loueth and moſte reuerenceth / and of the other ſide hateth and contemneth hym / that is thruſt vpon them / therfore it maketh muche to the profiting of the people in the doctrine of the goſpell / that the miniſter come in / by their conſent. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe / the people muſt by S. Paule hys rule / folowe the good example of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 12.</note> but men will not likely folowe their examples / whome they loue not / nor loue them / whych are thruſt vpon them againſt their willes / therfore it ſtandeth wyth the good conuerſation and godlye folowing of the ſteppes of the miniſter / that he be wyth the conſent of the Churche.</p>
               <p>And if it ſhould happen (whych may come to paſſe) that any church ſhould deſire or chuſe / or conſent vpon by the moſt part / ſome that is vnmete / eyther for doctrine or manners / then the miniſters and elders of the other churches rounde about / ſhould aduertiſe firſt / and afterward as occaſion ſhould ſerue / ſharply and ſeuerely charge / that they forbeare ſuche election / or if it be made / that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it not / by ſuffering him to exerciſe any miniſterie. And if eyther the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches round about do faile of this duety / or the church whych is admoniſhed / reſt not in their Admonition / then to bring it to the nexte Synode / and if it reſt not therin / then the Prince or Magiſtrate / whych muſt ſee that nothing in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be diſorderly and wickedly done / ought to driue that church from that elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an other whych is conuenient. Nowe I will examine the reaſons which you adde to proue / that although in times paſt the church chuſed their miniſters / yet nowe it muſt be otherwiſe.</p>

For in the Apoſtles times / the churche I meane viſible and ſenſible (for elſe how could it be perſecuted) was ſowne not only through out all Aſia (whych is the greateſt part of the world) but through a great part of Affrica / and no ſmall portion of Europe: and nowe it is ſhut in a ſmall corner of Europe / being altogither baniſhed out of Aſia and Affrica. And therfore there are not the tithe nowe / of thoſe that profeſſed the goſpell then / and what a concluſion is thys / the churches were few in numbre / becauſe they were vnder the croſſe.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21261:28"/> the church. You might as well haue placed in the church / Wolues / Tigres / Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons / and Beares / that is Tirantes and perſecutors. For thoſe ye ſpeake of / are (in the iudgement of men and of the church) as well ſhut out of it / as they in the eye of the Lord: they may in time be of the church / and ſo may and are ſometimes the perſecutors themſelues: ſo it appeareth that the election of the church / is not / nor ought not / to be hindered by thoſe / that haue nothing to do with it. But now I heare you aſke me / what then ſhal become of the Papiſts and Atheiſts / if you will not haue them be of the church? I anſwer that they may be of / &amp; in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth / whych neither may / nor can be of / nor in the churche. And therfore the churche hauing nothing to doe wyth ſuche / the magiſtrate ought to ſee / that they ioyne to heare the ſermons in the place where they are made / whether it be in thoſe pariſhes where there is a church / and ſo preaching / or where elſe he ſhall thinke beſt / and cauſe them to be examined / howe they profite / and if they profite not / to puniſhe them / &amp; as their contempt groweth / ſo to encreaſe the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t / vntill ſuche times as they declare manifeſt tokens of vnrepentantnes and then as rotten members / that doe not onlye no good / nor ſeruice in the bodye / but alſo corrupt and infect others / cut them off: And if they do profit in hearing / then to be adioyned vnto that church / whych is next the place of their dwelling.</p>

                  <p>If there be no churches eſtabliſhed / becauſe there are no chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates / then the churches of the Apoſtles were not eſtabliſhed. And it is abſurd to ſay / that the miniſters nowe wyth the helpe of the magiſtrate / can laye ſurer foundations of the church / or build more cunningly or ſubſtancially / then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles could / whych were the maſter builders of the church of God. And as for the conſummation of the body of the church / and the beautie of it / ſeeing it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in Ieſus Chriſte / whych is the heade / that is alwayes ioyned vnſeperably in all times of the croſſe / and not the croſſe wyth his body / whych is the church: I can not ſee why the churches vnder perſecution / ſhould not be eſtabliſhed / ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bothe the foundation and the nether moſt partes / as alſo the toppe and hyeſt parte of the churche / as well as thoſe whych haue a chriſtian magiſtrate. If in deede the magiſtrate / whom God hath ſanctified to be a nurſe vnto his churche / were alſo the head of the ſame / then the church could not be eſtabliſhed wythout the magiſtrate / but we learne that although the godly magiſtrate be the head of the common wealth / and a great ornament vnto the church / yet he is but a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſame. The churche maye be eſtabliſhed wythoute the magiſtrate / and ſo / that all the world / and all the Deuilles of hell can not ſhake it / but it can not be in quiet / in peace / and in outwarde ſuretie / wythout a godly magiſtrate: And therefore the churche in that reſpecte and ſuche like / praiſeth God and prayeth for the magiſtrate / by the whych it enioyeth ſo ſingulare benefites. Therevppon you conclude / that the church was then populare / whych is as vntrue / as the former parte. For the churche is gouerned wyth that kinde of gouernment / whych the Philoſophers / that wryte of the beſt common wealthes / affirme to be the beſt. For in reſpecte of Chriſte the heade / it is a Monarchie / and in reſpecte of the auncientes and paſtoures / that gouerne in common / and wyth like authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſte them ſelues / it is an Ariſtocratie / or the rule of the beſt men / and in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte that the people are not ſecluded / but haue their intereſt in churche matters / it is a Democratie / or a populare eſtate. An image whereof appeareth alſo in the pollicye of thys Realme / for as in reſpecte of the Queene her maieſtie / it is a Monarchie / ſo in reſpecte of the moſte honourable Counſell / it is an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie / and hauing regard to the Parliament / whych is aſſembled of al eſtates / it is a Democratie. But you ſhould haue ſhewed / howe this difference of hauing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21261:29"/> a chriſtian magiſtrate / &amp; hauing none / ought to bryng in a diuerſity in the choiſe of the paſtoure by their churche. It were not harde / if one woulde ſpende hys time ſo vnprofitably / to finde oute a hundred differences betweene a perſecuted church / and that whych is in peace / but ſeeing you can ſhewe me no reaſon / why the church may not chuſe her miniſter / as well vnder a godly magiſtrate / as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a tyrante / I will ſhewe you / howe that if it were lawfull to breake the order of God / it were meeter in the time of perſecution / that the election ſhoulde be in ſome other diſcreate and learned perſons hands / to be made without the conſent of the churche: then in that time when there is a godly magiſtrate / and that it is then moſt conuenient that he ſhould be choſen by the church.</p>
                  <p>In the time of perſecution a churche chuſeth an vnlearned miniſter / or one that is wicked in life / howſoeuer it be / he is vnfit / the churches rounde about by their miniſters or elders admoniſhe this church of her fault / and moue to correct it / the church will by no meanes be admoniſhed: what can nowe the other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do in the time of perſecution? if they excommunicate the whole churche / it is a hard matter / &amp; yet if they may do that / there is all they can do: the euil is not remedied / whych may be eaſely taken awaye / where there is a godly magiſtrate / and the churche (as is before ſayde) compelled to a better choyſe / ſo you ſee that there are inconueniences in the chuſing of the paſtor / and other the gouernors of the churche / by the churche / in the time of perſecution / whych are not in the time of peace vnder a chriſtian magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Now I wil ſhew you (which thinke that the conſent of the church in their miniſter / can not ſtand with the time of a chriſtian magiſtrate) that it hathe not only ſtode / but hath bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed in their times / and by them. <hi>In codice Iuſtiani:</hi> it is thus wrytten / following the doctrine of the holy Apoſtles. &amp;c. we ordaine / that as often as it ſhall fall out / that the miniſters place ſhall be voyde in any ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie / that voyces be geuen of the inhabiters of that city / that he of three (which for their right faith / holines of life / and other good things are moſt approued) ſhould be choſen to the Byſhoprike / whych is the moſte meete of them. Alſo Carolus Magnus / whych was the firſt Germaine Emperoure in. 63. <hi>diſtinct. ſacrorum canonum</hi> ſayth / being not ignorante of the holy Canons / that the holy churche in the name of God ſhould vſe her honoure the freelyer / we aſſent vnto the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall order / that the byſhops be choſen by election of the cleargye and people / according to the ſtatutes of the canons of that dioceſſe.</p>
                  <p>In the. 63. diſtinction it appeareth / that Ludouicus Carolus hys ſonne decreed / that he ſhould be biſhop of Rome / whom all the people of Rome ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to chuſe. Platina alſo in the life of pope Adrian. 2. writeth that Ludouike the ſeconde by hys letters commaunded the Romaines / that they ſhoulde chuſe their owne biſhop / not loking for other mennes voyces / whych being ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers / could not ſo well tell what was done in the common weale where they were ſtraungers / and that it appertained to the Citizens.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Platina witneſſeth in the life of Pope Leo the. 8. that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people of Rome were earneſt with the Emperoure Otho the firſt / that he wold take awaye one Pope Iohn that liued very licentiouſly and riotouſly / and place an other / the ſame Emperoure anſweared / that it pertained to the cleargye and people to chuſe one / and willed them that they ſhoulde chuſe / and he woulde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it: and when they had choſen Leo / and after put hym out wythout cauſe / and choſe one Pope Benet / he compelled them to take Leo agayne. Whereby appeareth that in thoſe eſtates where Magiſtrates were Chriſtian / and where the eſtate was moſte of all Monarchicall / that is ſubiecte to ones gouernment / that thys vſe of the Churche remained and was confirmed by the Emperours / and alſo when the churche put oute any wythout good cauſe / that then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhoulde compell the churches to doe their duetye. In deede the byſhop
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21261:29"/> of Rome gaue the election then into the Emperoure hys handes / becauſe of the lyghtneſſe of the people / as Platina maketh mention / but that is not the matter / for I do nothing elſe heere but ſhew / that the elections of the miniſters by the Church / were vſed in the times of the Emperoures / and by their conſentes: and ſeeing that Otho confeſſed it pertayned not vnto him / it is to be doubted / whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he tooke it at the Biſhop his handes.</p>
                  <p>And if the Emperoures permitted the election of the byſhop to that Citie / where it made moſt for their ſuertie to haue one of their owne appoyntment / as was Rome / which with their byſhoppes dyd often tymes put the good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roures to trouble: it is to be thought / that in other places both Cities &amp; townes / they dyd not deny the elections of the miniſters / to the people. Beſides that / cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of thoſe conſtitutions are not of Rome / but of any citie whatſoeuer. And theſe Emperoures were / and lyued betweene 500. and odde yeares / vntill the very poynt of a thouſande yeares after Chriſt / ſo that hyther to thys lyberty was not gone out of the Church / albeit the Pope which brought in all tyranny / and went about to take all libertie from the churches / was now on horſe backe / &amp; had placed hym ſelfe in that Antichriſtian ſeate.</p>

               <p>THoſe that write the Centuries / ſuſpect thys Canon / and doubt whether it be a baſtarde or no / conſidering the practiſe of the church: But heere or euer you were aware / you haue ſtriken at your ſelfe. For before you ſayde / that thys order of chuſing the miniſter by voyces of the church / was but in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tyme / and duryng the time of perſecution. And the firſt time you can alledge thys libertie to be taken awaye / was in the 334. yeare of our Lorde / which was at the leaſt 31. yeares after that Conſtantine the great began to raigne. I ſay at the leaſt / becauſe there be good authors that ſay / that thys Councell of Laodicea was holden Anno. 338. after the death of Iouinian the Emperoure / and ſo there is 35. yeares betweene the beginning of Conſtantines raigne / and thys councel. Now I thinke you will not ſay that the Church was vnder perſecution in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantines tyme. And therfore you ſee you are greatly deceiued in your accoumpt.</p>
               <p>And if it be as lawfull for vs to vſe maiſter Caluins authoritie / which both by example and wrytings hath alwayes defended our cauſe / as it is for you to wryng him and his wordes / to things which he neuer meant / and the contrary wherof he continually practiſed / then thys authoritie of youres is daſhed. For <note place="margin">Vppon the Actes. 16.</note> maiſter Caluin ſayth / where as it is ſayd in that councel / that the election ſhould not be permitted to the people / it meaneth nothing elſe but that they ſhould make no election / without hauing ſome miniſters or men of iudgement / to direct them in their election / and to gather their voyces / and prouyde that nothing be done tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuouſly / euen as Paule and Barnabas were cheefe in the election of the churches. And euen the ſame order woulde we haue kepte in elections continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for auoyding of confuſion / for as we would haue the libertie of the Church preſerued / which Chriſt hath bought ſo dearely from all tyranny / ſo do we agayne condemne and vtterly abhorre all barbarous confuſion and diſorder.</p>
               <p>But if councelles be of ſo great authoritie to decide thys controuerſy / then the moſt famous councell of Nice will ſtrike a great ſtroke with you / which in an Epiſtle that it wryteth vnto the Church of Egipt (as Theodoret maketh mention) ſpeaketh thus. It is meete that you ſhould haue power both to chuſe any man / and to geue their names which are worthy to be amongſt the clergye / and to doe all things abſolutely according to the law and decrees of the churche. And if it happen any to dye in the churche / then thoſe which were laſt taken / are to be promoted to the honor of him that is dead / with thys condition / if they be

               <p>An other of the famouſeſt councelles / called the councell of Conſtantinople / which was gathered vnder Theodoſius y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great (as it is witneſſed by the * Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite <note place="margin">9.

               <p>Likewiſe in the councell of Carthage where Auguſtine was / holden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>anno domini</hi> 400. in the firſt canon of the councell it is ſayde / when hee hath bene examyned in all theſe / and founde fully inſtructed / then let hym be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned Byſhop by the common conſent of the clarkes and the lay people / and the Byſhoppes of the prouince / and eſpecially eyther by the authoritie or preſence of the metropolitane.</p>
               <p>And in the Toletane councell / as it appeareth in the 51. diſtinction / it was thus ordayned.

               <p>IN deede if you put ſuch darke coleures vpon the Apoſtles church as thys is / it is no maruell if it ought not to be a patrone to vs of framing and faſhioning our church after it. But O Lord who can paciently heare thys horrible diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der / aſcribed to the Apoſtles church / which heere you attribute vnto it: that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hand ouer head preached / baptiſed / and expounded the Scriptures.

For if it be falſe (as it is moſt falſe) then there is no difference heere betwene the Apoſtles times and oures. Doth not the whole courſe of the ſcriptures declare / and hath it not bene proued / that there was none that tooke vppon hym the miniſterie in the churche / but by lawfull calling? what is thys but to caſt duſt and dirte of the faireſt and beautifulleſt image that euer was / to make a ſmokie / diſfigured / euill proportioned image to ſeeme beautifull / to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Apoſtles buildings of golde and ſiluer and precious ſtones / to make a cottage of wode / ſtraw / and ſtubble / to haue ſome eſtymation / which could haue none / the other ſtanding.

               <p>THe place is too common which you aſſigne / you had I am ſure the booke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you / you might haue tolde where the place was / and in what title. But that place of Muſculus in the title of the magiſtrate / is anſwered by hym ſelfe in the ſame booke / where he entreateth of the election of the miniſters. For going about (as it ſeemeth) to ſatiſfie ſome of their miniſters / which were brought in doubt of their calling / becauſe they were not choſen by their churches / ſpeaking of the vſe of the church in chuſing their miniſter / he ſayth thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt / it muſt be playnly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed / that the miniſters were in times paſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by conſent of the people / and ordayned and confirmed of the ſemores.</p>
               <p>Secondarily / that that forme of election was Apoſtolicall and lawfull.</p>
               <p>Thirdly / that it was conformable to the libertie of the churche / and that thruſting the paſtor vpon the church / not being choſen of it / doth agree to a church that is not free but ſubiect to bondage.</p>
               <p>Fourthly / that thys fourme of choiſe by the church maketh much bothe to that / that the miniſter may gouerne hys flocke with a good conſcience / as alſo that the people may yeelde them ſelues to be eaſtyer ruled / then when one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth agaynſt their willes vnto them.</p>
               <p>And to conclude all theſe / he ſayeth that they are altogether certayne / and ſuch as can not be denyed. After he ſayth that the corrupt eſtate of the churche and religion driueth to alter this order / and to call the election to certayne lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men / which ſhoulde after be confirmed of the Prince. And that it may yet more clearely appeare that hys iudgement is nothing leſſe then to confirme thys election / he ſetteth downe their election in Bernland / which he approueth and laboureth to make good / as one which although it doth not fully agree with the election of the prymitine churche / yet commeth very neare vnto it: As that not one man but all the miniſters in the citie of Berne / doe chuſe a paſtor when there is any place voyde.</p>
               <p>Afterward he is ſent to the Senate / from the which / if he be doubted of / he is ſent agayne to the miniſters / to be examined / and then if they fynde him meete / he is confirmed of the Senate / (which ſtandeth of ſome number of the people) and by the moſt part of their voyces. By theſe things it appeareth / that this elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miniſter by the people / is lawfull and Apoſtolike / and confeſſed alſo by him / that thoſe that are otherwiſe / bring with them ſubiection vnto the church / and ſeruitude / and cary a note and marke of corruption of religion.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all / that he goeth about to defende the election vſed in the churches where he was miniſter / by this / that it approched vnto the election in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churche. Nowe what cauſe there may bee / that we ſhould bring the church into bondage / or take away that order wherby both the myniſter may be better aſſured of hys calling / and the people may the willinglyer ſubmit them ſelues vnto their paſtoures and gouernoures / or what cauſe to depart from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike forme of the choiſe of the paſtor being lawfull / I confeſſe I know not / and would be glad to learne.</p>
               <p>To aſſigne the cauſe hereof vnto the chriſtian magiſtrate / &amp; to ſay / that theſe things can not be had vnder hym (as you / vnder maiſter Muſcuius name / doe affirme) is to doe great iniurie vnto the office of the magiſtrate / which abridgeth not the liberty of the churche / but defendeth it / dimmiſheth not the paſtor his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his calling / but rather encreaſeth it / by eſtabliſhing the ordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings only / which in the time of perſecution ſometimes are not ſo ordinary / with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth not the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the people from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſtor / but vrgeth it / where it is not / &amp; conſtrayneth it / wher it is not volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary. And ſeeing that alſo Muſculus ſayth / that theſe forced elections are remedies for corruption of relygion / and diſordered
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21261:31"/> ſtates / what greater diſhonoure can there be done vnto the holye inſtitution of God in the ciuile gouernoure / then to ſay that theſe forced elections without the conſent of the people muſt be / where there is a chriſtian Magiſtrate: as thoughe there coulde be no pure religion vnder him / when as in deede it may be eaſely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him pure / which can hardly / and with great daunger / be pure without him. And when as it is ſayd / that the churches conſent ſhould be had in the election of the miniſter / we doe not denye the confirmation of the elections vnto the godly ciuill magiſtrate / and the diſanulling of them / if the church in chuſing / and the miniſters in directing / ſhall take any vnfitte man / ſo that yet / he doe not take away the libertie from the church / of chuſing a more conuenient man.</p>
               <p>So that you ſee / that by Muſculus your witneſſe reaſons / this enforced e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection without the conſent of the people / is but corrupt / and ſo ought not to be in the churche.

               <p>NOw you would proue that thys election of miniſters by one man was in the Apoſtles time. But you haue forgotten your ſelfe / which ſayde a little before / that this election by the church / was not only in the Apoſtles times / but alſo in the tyme of Cyprian: now you ſay otherwiſe. And if the election of the miniſtery by the church agree ſo wel with the time of perſecution / and when there is no chriſtian Magiſtrate / how commeth it to paſſe / that in thoſe dayes when perſecution was ſo hotte / and there were no ſuch Magiſtrates / that S.

               <p>I ſaye firſt / that S. Paule wryteth to Timothe / and therefore inſtructeth hym what he ſhould do for his parte in the appoynting of the miniſter.

Then I ſay further / that S. Paule attributeth that vnto Timothe / that was common to moe with hym / becauſe he being the director and moderator of the election / is ſayde to doe that whiche many doe: which thing I haue proued by dyuers examples both out of the ſcripture / and otherwiſe before. And euen in this impoſition of handes / it is manifeſtly to be ſhewed. For that where as S. Paule ſayth in the 2. Epiſtle / <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 6.</note> that Timothe was ordayned by the putting on of hys hands vppon hym / in the firſt Epiſtle he ſayth / that he was ordayned by the putting on of the handes of <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4/12.</note> the elderſhip. So that that which he in one place taketh to him ſelfe alone / in the other he communicateth with moe. And that he dyd it not him ſelfe alone / it may appeare by thoſe wordes which folow (and communicate not with other mens ſinnes) as if he ſhould ſaye / if other will ordeyne inſuffycient miniſters / yet be not thou caryed away with their example. And further that his authoritie was equall with other elders of that church / and that he had no ſuperioritie aboue his fellowes / it may appeare / for that he ſayth lay thy hands raſhly of none / where if he had had authoritie ouer the reſt / he would rather haue ſayd / ſuffer none to lay
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21261:31"/> his handes raſhly. Agayne / it is a fault in you / that you can not diſtinguiſhe or put difference betweene the election and impoſition of handes.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all / I anſwere that although this might agree to Timothe alone / as in deede it can not / yet it followeth not that euery Biſhop may do ſo. For Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe was an Euangeliſt / which was aboue a Biſhop / as hereafter ſhall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeare. And it is an euill argument to ſay the greater may do it / therfore the leſſe may do it. The ſuperiour / therfore the inferioure. If you were at any coſt with producing your witneſſes / you ſhould not be ſo vnwiſe to be ſo lauiſhe of them / as to cite Ambroſe / and Chriſoſtome / to proue a thing that none hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer denyed. For who denyeth that S. Paule doth not geue warning to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the to be circumſpect? If you meane to vſe their teſtimonie to proue that he only made the elections / they ſaye neuer a word for you / if there be any thing / cite it. To the place of Titus / I anſwere as to that of Timothe / for there is nothing there / but agreeth alſo to thys place. And as for Ierome he hath nothing in that place / as he hath in no other / to proue that to the Biſhop only / doth belong the right of election of the miniſter.</p>
               <p>I haue ſhewed you reaſons before / why it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be ſo taken of the ſole elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhop / the church being ſhutte out. If authoritie woulde doe any good in thys behalfe / as it ſeemeth it ought / ſeeing that all your proofe throughe out the whole booke / is in the authorities of men / (which Ariſtotle calleth <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>technas peiſeis,</hi> vncunning proofes) I coulde ſende you to maiſter Calum / which teacheth / that it is not to be thought that S. Paule woulde permit to Titus to ordayne byſhoppes and miniſters by hys owne authoritie / when he hym ſelfe would not take ſo much vpon hym / but ioyned hys with the voyces of the church. But he peraduenture ſauoureth not your taſt / and yet you woulde make men beleue ſometimes / that you make muche of hym if you can gette but one worde vnioynted / and racked in peeces from the reſt / to make good your part. If hee weyghe not with you / you haue maiſter Muſculus / whome you take to bee a <note place="margin">Muſculus in his common places in his title of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> great patrone of youres in thys cauſe / which dothe with greater vehemencie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame thing that mayſter Caluin ſayth / aſking whether any man can beleeue that Paiſle permitted in thys place to Titus / or in the place before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to Timothe / that they ſhoulde ordayne of theyr owne authoritie / and by them ſelues / when as Paule woulde not doe it but by the voyces and election of the churche.</p>
               <p>In the ende you ſay it is the generall conſent of all the learned fathers / that it belongeth to the byſhop to chuſe the miniſter. Becauſe you acquaint my eares with ſuch bolde and vntrue affirmations / I can now the more paciently heare you thus vaunting your ſelfe / as though you had all the fathers by heart / and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed them about with you / whereſoeuer you went / whereas / if a man woulde meaſure you by the ſkill in them which you haue ſhewed heere / he woulde hardly beleeue that you had redde the tenthe part of them.</p>
               <p>Are all the learned fathers of that mynde? I thinke then you would haue bene better aduiſed then to haue ſette downe but one / when as you know a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in controuerſie / will not be tryed but by two or three witneſſes / vnleſſe the Lord ſpeake hym ſelfe / and therefore you geue me occaſion to ſuſpect that becauſe you cite but one / you know of no more: now let vs ſee what your one witneſſe will depoſe in thys matter.</p>
               <p>And fyrſt of all you haue done more wiſely then ſimply / in that you haue altered Ieromes wordes. For where hee ſayeth / wherein doth a byſhoppe differ from an elder / but only in ordayning: you ſay a byſhop doth excell all other myniſters. &amp;c. I report me heere vnto your conſcience / whether you dyd not of purpoſe chaunge Ieromes hys ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / becauſe you wold not let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reader vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what oddes is betweene S. Ieromes biſhops in his dayes / &amp; betwene our
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21261:32"/> Lord Biſhoppes. For then the byſhop had nothing aboue an elder or other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter / but only the ordayning of the miniſter. Now he hath a thouſande pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes / where the miniſter hath but one. For the matters alſo of the ſubſtaunce of the miniſterie / the biſhop now excommunicateth / which the miniſter can not / ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth or receyueth into the church / which the miniſter can not. Beſides diuers other things which are meere ciuill which the byſhop doth / and which neither byſhop nor other miniſter ought to doe. I ſay I reporte me to your conſcience / whether you altered Ieromes wordes to thys ende / that you would keepe thys from the knowledge of your reader or no. For anſwere to the place / it is an euill argument to ſaye the byſhop had the ordayning of the miniſter. Ergo he had the election of hym / the contrary rather is a good argument / the byſhop had the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayning of the miniſter / therefore he had not the election of hym. For ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and election are dyuers members of one whole / which is the placing of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor in hys church / and one member can not be verified of an other / as you can not ſay your foote is your hand. I will not deny / but that ſometimes theſe wordes maye bee founde confounded in Eccleſiaſticall wryters / but I will ſhewe you alſo / that they are diſtinguiſhed / and that the election pertayneth to the people / and ordayning vnto the Byſhop.</p>
               <p>Vpon the ſixte of the Actes the gloſe hath / that that which was done there of the xij. Apoſtles / in willing the brethren to loke out fitte men / was done to geue vs example / &amp; muſte be obſerued in thoſe that are ordayned. For ſayth the gloſe / the people muſt chuſe / and the Byſhoppe muſt ordayne. And that S. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome muſt be ſo vnderſtanded / it appeareth not only that it hath beene ſo expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but alſo it may be caſely proued / for that S. Ieromes ſentence and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appeareth in other places / that he woulde haue nothing heere done with out the people / as in his Epiſtle / <hi>ad Ruſticum monachum:</hi> he willeth that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhoulde haue power and authoritie to chuſe their clarkes and their miniſters / and in hys Epiſtle to Neopotian / of the lyfe of the clarkes / he hath thys diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion manifeſtly: They runne / ſayth he / vnto the Biſhoppes ſuffragans certen times of the yeare / and bringing ſome ſumme of money / they are annoynted / and ordayned / being choſen of none / and afterwarde / the Biſhoppe without any lawfull election / is choſen in hugger mugger / of the Canons or Prebendaries only / without the knowledge of the people. And ſo you ſee / that although y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> S. Ierome ſayeth / that the Byſhop had the ordayning of the miniſters / yet he had not the election / for the ordayning was nothing elſe but an approuing of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / by putting on of handes / and conſequently / hauing made your vaunt that all the learned fathers were of thys iudgement / that the Biſhop ſhould elect the miniſter / you ſhew not ſo much as one.</p>
               <p>Now will I ſhewe you the cleane contrary of that you ſaye / not that I gladlye trauaile thys wayes / for if you had not conſtrayned me / you ſhoulde not haue hearde one voyce thys way. And woulde to God that you woulde be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent / eſpecially when you meete with thoſe that will be tryed by the ſcriptures / to ſeeke no farther ſtrengthe then they geue you. But I am lothe you ſhoulde oppreſſe the truthe / and make all men afrayde of it / by making them beleeue / that it is ſo deſolate and forſaken of her frendes / as you pretende. You confeſſe S. Cyprian is agaynſte you herein / and he was a learned father / and a Martyr al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo / whych dyd not only vſe thys forme of election / but alſo taught it to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry / and commaunded / and therefore me thincketh you ſhoulde not haue ſayde all the learned fathers without exception. You ſee alſo S. Ierome is of an other iudgement. S. Auguſtine alſo / when hee ſpeaketh how hee appoynted Eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us to ſucceede hym / ſheweth / howe it was the approued right and cuſtome / that the whole church ſhoulde eyther chuſe / or conſent of their Biſhoppe. And * Ambroſe ſayeth / that that is truely and certaynely a diuine election to the office <note place="margin">Epiſt. 81.</note>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:21261:32"/> of a byſhop / which is made of the whole church. Eregorius Nazianzene in the Oration which he had at the death of hys father / hath diuers things which proue that the election of the miniſter pertayned to the Churche / and confuteth thoſe thinges which ſhould ſeeme to hinder it. Theſe were learned fathers / and yet thought not that the election of the paſtor or byſhop / pertayned to one man alone but that the church had alſo hir intereſt / therefore you ſee all the learned fathers are not of that mynde / you ſay they are.</p>
               <p>And that thys election continued in the churche / vntill within a three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares / at what time there was more then Egyptiacall / and palpable darck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ouer the face of the whole earth / it may appeare in a Treatiſe of Flaccus Illir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For lacking op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities diuers wayes / I was contented ſomewhat to vſe the collection to my commoditie / for the more ſpeedie furtheraunce / and better proceeding in other matters / which I will leaue of / becauſe they may be there red of thoſe that be learned / whome I will alſo referre to the ſixe and ſeuen bookes of Euſebius / wher both the formes of the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in thoſe tymes are deſcribed / &amp; wher / beſides that the cuſtomes of the peoples choiſe is ſet forth / there are examples of the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people and cleargie / which were confirmed by the chriſtian Magiſtrate / namely in the Byſhop of Conſtantinople.

I will adde only one place / which if it be more bitter then the reſt / and cutte the quicke more neare / you ſhall not bee angry with me / but firſt with thoſe that were the authors of it / and then wyth him that wrote it.</p>
               <p>Euſebius ſpeaking of Origine / which was admitted not of one Biſhop / <note place="margin">6. <hi>Lib. cap.</hi> 20.</note> but of many Byſhoppes to teache / ſheweth how the Byſhoppes were reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Byſhoppe of Alexandria called Demetrius / becauſe they had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him without the election of the preſbyterie of the churche / which were the cheefe in the election in euery church / and vnto the which the churches did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte the gouernment of them ſelues in euery ſeuerall towne and Citie / &amp; ſayth / that it hath not beene hearde that <hi>laikous</hi> ſhoulde <hi>homilein paronton ton epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon:</hi> which is / that the lay men ſhould teach when the Byſhoppes were preſent / whereby it is euident / that he counted hym a lay man / which was only admitted by the Byſhops / although they were many / not being firſt elected by the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of that church wherof he was the teacher.</p>
               <p>Seing then that the ſcripture doth teache thys order / that there ſhoulde be no miniſter thruſt vppon the churche / but by the conſent thereof / and reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth that wayes / and the vſe of the churche hath beene ſo from time to time / both in peace and in time of perſecution / bothe vnder tyrantes and godly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / it can not be without the highe diſpleaſure of almightie God / the great hurte and ſore oppreſſion of the churche / that one man ſhoulde take thys vnto hym / which pertayneth to ſo many / or one miniſter / which pertayneth to more then one / eſpecially / where the aduiſe of learned miniſters may concurre with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples election or conſent.</p>

               <p>THe reaſon is of greater force then you woulde ſeeme to make it / for as the twelueth place was to Mathias / ſo is a certayne churche vnto a paſtor or myniſter / and as the Apoſtles ordayned none vnto that place / before it was voyde / ſo ought not the Byſhoppe ordayne anye / vntill there be a churche voyde and deſtitute of a paſtor. And as the Apoſtles ordayned not any Apoſtle / further then they had teſtimonie of the worde of God / as it appeareth that S. Peter <note place="margin">Act. 1. 20.</note> proceedeth by that rule to the election / ſo ought no byſhop ordayne anye to anye function / which is not in the ſcripture appoynted: but there are by the worde of God at thys time / no ordinarie miniſteries eccleſiaſticall / which be not locall / and tyed to one congregation / therefore thys ſending abrode of miniſters / which haue no places / is vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>And that it may the better appeare / that thoſe functions doe only remayne / which are appoynted to one certayne place / and that the reader may haue the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and playner vnderſtanding of all this matter / all the whole eccleſiaſticall func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be well deuided: firſt into extraordinarie / or thoſe that endured for a time / and into ordinarie / which are perpetuall. Of the firſt ſorte are the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes / which the Lord vſed for a tyme as it were for cheefe maſons / and principall builders of his church / as well to lay the foundations of churches where none were / as alſo to aduaunce them to ſuch forwardneſſe and heighte / vntill there mighte be gotten / for the finiſhing of the building and houſe of the Church fitte paſtors / elders / and deacons. And that being done / they went from thoſe places into others / which thing may be perceiued by the continuall ſtorie of the Actes of the Apoſtles / and by diuers ſentences which are found in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of S. Paule. And therefore alſo / when the churches haue beene by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt euen raſed from the foundations / God hathe ſtirred vp Euangeliſtes euen immediatly by this ſpirite / without any calling of men / to reſtore hys churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne: of whiche ſorte was Maiſter Wickliffe in our Countrie / Maiſter Hus and Ierome of Prage in Bohemia / Luther and ♉winglius in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. &amp;c. And after thys ſorte / God maye at hys good pleaſure worke / when hee purpoſeth to ſet in hys goſpell in anye nation / where the whole face of the earth is couered wyth the darckeneſſe of ignoraunce / and wante of the knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>Of this ſort of extraordinary functions are the Prophetes alſo / which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a ſingular dexteritie and readines of expounding the ſcriptures / had alſo the gift of telling things to come / which becauſe it is not now ordinarily / I thincke there is none wildeny / but it is an extraordinary calling: For the other two of the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes / it ſhall appeare more at large hereafter (by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion geuen by maiſter Doctor) that they are but for a tune.</p>
               <p>The ordinary &amp; continual functions of the church / are alſo deuided into two partes / for eyther they are they that gouerne or take charge of the whole church / as are thoſe which are called elders / or they which take charge of one part of the Churche (which is the poore of euery church) as are thoſe which are called dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. Thoſe agayne that are <hi>presbyteri</hi> / which we terme elders of the church / and haue to do with the whole church / are eyther thoſe which teache and preach the word of God / and gouerne so / or elſe which gouerne only / and do not teach nor preach. Of the firſt kinde are paſtors &amp; doctore. Of the ſecond are thoſe / which are called by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon name of elders or auncients. Of all this ordinary function I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21261:33"/> ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake / and of euery one ſhall appeare that (which I haue ſayd before) that they are no vncertaine and vndefunte miniſteries / but ſuch as are limited vnto a certaine churche and congregation. And firſt of all for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor or byſhoppe whych is heere mentioned: whych name ſo euer we conſider of them / they do forthwith as ſone as they are once either ſpoken or thought of / im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and infer a certen and definite charge / being as the Logicians terme them / actuall relatiues. For what ſhepheard can there be / vnles he haue a flocke? and howe can he be a watchman / vnles he haue ſome citie to loke vnto? Or how can a man be a maſter / onles he haue a ſeruaunt? Or a father vnles he haue a childe? Nowe if you will ſay that they haue a charge / and they haue flockes and cities to attende and watche vppon / for a wholo ſhire / or prouince / or realme / are their flockes / and their cities / and their charges.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all in your reading miniſters that is vntrue / for they goe not to reade in all churches / but tary vntill they be hired in one. And therfore when the Biſhop hath laide hys hand of them / they are no more miniſters then before hys hund came vpon them / becauſe they haue no charges / and therfore the patrone or perſon that hireth them to read / and ſetteth them a worke are their byſhops / and make them miniſters / and not the Biſhop of the dioceſe.</p>
               <p>Secondarily for thoſe that preache to haue a whole dioceſe / or prouince / or realme to be their flocke / or citie to attend vpon / is contrary to the pollicy or good huſbandrye of all thoſe / that woulde eyther haue their citie ſafe / or their flockes ſound. For who are they whych would appoynt one for the watch of a thouſand townes or cities / when as all they whych loue their ſafetye / woulde rather haue for euery citye many watchmen / then for many cities one? or what is he that is ſo watchfull and circumſpect / whoſe diligence and watchfulnes one citye aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wyth ennemies / will not wholely occupy and take vp? or what is he whoſe ſight is ſo ſharpe / that he can ſee from one ende of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dioceſe / or prouince / or realme to the other ende thereof? or what is he that will commit the keeping of .xx. M. ſheepe to one man / that loketh for any good / or encreaſe of them? howe ſhall all theſe heare hys whiſtle / howe ſhall all knowe his voyce / when they can not heare it? how ſhall they acknowledge hym / when they can not knowe hym? howe ſhall they folowe him / when they can not ſee him goe before? howe ſhall he heale their diſeaſes / when he can not poſſibly know them. But ſome man wil ſay / that theſe are humaine reaſons / and likelyhodes whych maye be ouerthrowne wyth other ſimilitudes. Theſe notwithſtanding are Analogies drawne from the nature of thoſe things whych the miniſters are likened vnto / and are of the moſte parte v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the holy Ghoſte hym ſelfe expreſly. But that there be no controuerſy left in this poynt / what is a flocke? S. Paule defineth it plainly / when he ſayeth: ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynte <note place="margin">Titus. 1. 5.</note> paſtors / or elders / or byſhops (for theſe woordes are indifferently vſed) through / not euery ſhire / or prouince / or realme / but through euery city / or town. And leaſt that any man ſhould here take occaſion to conclude / that then it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for one manne to be biſhoppe or paſtor of a whole Citie / ſuche as London or Yorke. &amp;c. S. Luke in the Actes dothe declare the meaning of this place / where <note place="margin">14. Chap. 23.</note> he ſayth / that they appoynted elders throughoute euery congregation / ſo that if the citie or towne be great / and the profeſſors of the goſpell in it / be more then wil make conueniently a congregation / then there muſte be by the rule of God more paſtors and byſhops. Whervpon it appeareth / that bothe no paſtor or byſhoppe ought to be made without there be a flocke / as it were a voyde place for him / and that a flocke is not a realme / or prouince / or dioces (as we now call a dioces) but ſo many as may conueniently meete in one aſſembly or congregation. And that thys is the meaning of S. Paule / it appeareth by the practiſe of the Churches from time to time / whych haue both decreed againſt / and found fault wyth theſe wandering / and rouing miniſteries.</p>

               <p>But you aſke what place Paule &amp; Barnabas had apoynted them.

               <p>THys paſſeth all the diuinitie that euer I red / that there are now Apoſtles / and Euangeliſtes / and Prophetes. You ſhall aſſuredly doe maruelles if you proue that / as you ſay you will / if any denye it / I denye it / proue you it. And that you may haue ſome thing to doe more / then peraduenture you thoughte of / when you wrote theſe words / I will ſhew you my reaſons why I thinke there ought to be none / nor can be none / vnles they haue wonderfull and extraordinarie callings. It muſt firſt be vnderſtanded / that the ſignification of thys worde A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle / when it is properly taken / extendeth it ſelfe not only to all the miniſters of God being ſent of God / but to the ambaſſadoure of any Prince or Noble man / or that is ſent of any publike authoritie / and is vſed of the ſcripture by the trope of <hi>Synechdoche</hi> for the twelue / that oure ſauior Chriſt appoynted to go through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the world / to preache the goſpell / vnto the whych number was added S. Paule and as ſome thinke Barnabas / whych are ſeuered from all other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the goſpell by theſe notes.</p>
               <p>Firſt that they were immediately called of God / as ſ. Paule to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians / <note place="margin">Galath. 1. 1.</note> proueth him ſelfe to be an apoſtle / becauſe he was not appoynted by men.</p>
               <p>Then / that they ſawe Chriſte / whych argument S. Paule vſeth. Am I <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 1.</note> not an Apoſtle? haue I not ſeene Chriſte?</p>
               <p>Thirdly / that theſe had the fielde of the whole worlde to Till / where as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are reſtrained more perticularly / as to a certen ploughe lande / wherein they ſhoulde occupye them ſelues. Wherevppon it followeth / that as we conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope truely / that he can be no ſucceſſor of the Apoſtles / not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he neyther reacheth / nor dothe as they did / but becauſe the Apoſtles haue no ſucceſſors / neither any can ſucceede into the office of an Apoſtle: ſo maye we likewiſe conclude againſt thoſe / that would haue the Apoſtles nowe adayes / that there can be none / becauſe there is none / vnto whome all theſe three notes doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: as that he is bothe ſent of God immediately / or that he hath ſeene Chriſt / or that he is ſent into all the world.</p>
               <p>And althoughe ſome Eccleſiaſticall wryters do call ſometimes good mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles yet that is to be vnderſtanded becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſame doctrine y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they did / not becauſe they ſucceded into the ſame kinde
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21261:35"/> of function / whych they could not doe. S. Paule doth vſe this word (Apoſtle) ſometimes in hys proper and natiue ſignification for hym that is publikely ſent from any to other / as when he ſpeaketh of the brethren that were ioyned wyth Titus / whych were ſent by the churches wyth reliefe to the pore church in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem and Iewrie / and where he calleth Epaphroditus an Apoſtle. But that <note place="margin">1. Cor. 8. 23. Phillip. 2. 25.</note> is wyth addition / and not ſimply / as in the firſt place he calleth the brethren the apoſtles of the Churches / that is not the apoſtles of all Churches / or ſent to all churches / but the apoſtles whych certaine churches ſent with the reliefe to other certaine churches / and Epaphroditus he calleth not an apoſtle ſimply / but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the Philippians / that is whych the Philippians ſent wyth reliefe to Paule being in priſon at Rome / as it appeareth in the ſame Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>And as for Andronicus and Iunius whych are by you recited / belyke to proue that we may haue more apoſtles / becauſe it is ſayd of S. Paule that they were famous and notable amongſt the apoſtles / it cannot be proued by any thing <note place="margin">16. Rom. 7.</note> I ſee there / whether they had any function Eccleſiaſticall or no. For S. Paule calleth them hys kinneffolke / and fellowe priſonners / and dothe not ſay that they were his fellowe labourers: and a man may be well notable and famous amongſt the apoſtles / and well knowne vnto them / whych is no apoſtle. And if the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would haue had this order of the apoſtles to continue in the church / there is no doubt but that they would haue choſen one into Iames hys roume when he <note place="margin">12. Actes. 2.</note> was ſlaine / as they did when they ſupplied the place of Iudas / by chuſing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias / and ſo euer as they had died / the other would haue put other in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So it appeareth that thys function of the apoſtles is ceaſed.</p>
               <p>You aſke farther / that if a man ſhould not preach before he haue a paſtoral charge / what they will anſwere vnto Phillip and Epaphroditus / wherby your meaning is belike / that although they be no paſtors / yet they may be euangeliſts whych goe about the countrey heere and there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this office is ceaſed in the church / as the apoſtles is / ſauing that ſometime the Lord doth raiſe vp ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily / for the building vp of the churches whych are falne downe / &amp; pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp by the foundations / as I haue ſhewed ſomewhat before. And that it is ceaſed / it may appeare by theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt / for becauſe all thoſe that the ſcripture calleth preciſely Euangeliſts / (which are only Phillip and Timothe) had their callings confirmed by miracle / <note place="margin">Act. 8. 39. 1. Tim. 1. 18.</note> and ſo it is like that Titus / and Syluanus / and Apollos / and if there were any other / had their vocations after the ſame manner confirmed / but there is no ſuch miraculous confirmation nowe / therfore there is no ſuche vocation. For allbeit thoſe that God hathe raiſed vp in thoſe darke times / and ouerthrowes of the church / wherof me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion is made before / as M. Luther. &amp;c. had not their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>allings alwayes confirmed by direct and manifeſt miracles of hearing or raiſing vp from the deade: yet the maruellous ſucces and bleſſing that the Lord gaue vnto their labors / were ſufficient ſeales vnto all men / that althoughe they had no ordinarie calling / nor by men / yet they were ſent of God? That I ſpeake nothing of the miraculous deliuerances that ſome of them had out of dangers / by warning ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of pearils by thoſe whych were neuer ſeene before nor after / and by ſuch like wonderfull meanes / as are to be ſeene in ſtories.</p>
               <p>Nowe againe / if there ſhould be any Euangeliſt / who ſhould ordaine him? you will ſay the Biſhop. But I ſay that cannot be / that the greater ſhoulde be ordained of the les. For the Euangeliſte is a higher degree in the churche / then <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 7.</note> is the byſhop or paſtor. And if he be ſo / whye hathe he not hys eſtimation heere in the Churche aboue the Byſhop or Archbyſhop eyther? for the Archbyſhop is but a Byſhop / or whye dothe not he ordaine Byſhoppes as Timothe and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus did / whych were Euangeliſtes / being one poynte of their office as * Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius <note place="margin">

               <p> Againe / if there be in euery churche a paſtor / as S. Paule commaundeth / what ſhould the Euangeliſts do? for either that paſtor doth his duetie / and then the Euangeliſt is ſuperfluous / or if he do it not / then he is no lawfull paſtor / and ſo ought he to be put out / &amp; an other to be put in hys ſtead. And where the paſtor doing hys duety can not ſuffice / there the ſcripture hath geuen him an ayde of the doctor / which for becauſe his office conſiſteth in teaching doctrine / to thys ende y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the paſtor mighte not be driuen to ſpende ſo muche time in propounding the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine / but might haue the more time to employ in exhorting and dehorting / &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the doctrine to the times and places / and perſons / it is manifeſt that he alſo is tied to a certaine church. For howe could he be an aide vnto the paſtor to whoſe helpe he is geuen / onles he were in the ſame churche where the paſtor is? And that the Euangeliſtes office hath bene ſo taken as a function that endured but for a time / it maye appeare firſt by that whych Euſebius wryteth / ſpeaking <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. 10</note> of Pantenus / for ſayeth he / there were vntill that time Euangeliſts. &amp;c. whych was about the yeare of our Lord. 162. whereby he geueth to vnderſtand / that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time they ceaſſed / and that in his time there was none / when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there were Byſhops or paſtors / elders and Deacons. And Ambroſe <note place="margin">1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>li. offic.</hi>
                  </note> ſayth that there be no Apoſtles / but thoſe whych Chriſt himſelfe dyd appoynte / whereby it appeareth that of all the Eccleſiaſticall functions that preache the worde / there are but the paſtor and Doctor only left vnto vs / and the ſame alſo reſtrained to particulare charges.</p>
               <p>Now that I haue proued that there are no Euangeliſts / Prophets / or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles / and that the miniſteries of the worde whych remaine / are limited vnto certaine places / I will take that whych you graunte / that is / that the paſtor or byſhop / ought to haue a ſpeciall flocke. And demaund of you wherfore he ſhould haue it? is it not to attend vpon it? and can he attend vpon it / onles he be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and abiding vpon it? but he can not be abiding vpon it / if he go from place to place to preach where he thincketh neceſſary: therfore being paſtor or biſhop of a congregation allotted vnto him / he maye not goe from place to place to preache where he thinketh good / muche les to haue a maſterſhip of a colledge in one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the land / a deanrie in an other / and a prebend in the third / and ſo be abſent from his paſtorall charge in ſuch places / where either he preacheth not / or nedeth not to preach / thoſe places being otherwiſe furniſhed wythout him. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how is this difference kept betweene the paſtor &amp; other miniſters / that the one is tied to a place / &amp; the other is not. For if you ſay that it is in that he ſhall preach more at his flocke / then at other places / I anſwer that the Euangeliſts and Apoſtles did tary longer in one place then in another / &amp; taught ſome congregations yeres / when they did not other ſome monethes. And therefore they ſay nothing / whych alledge for the non reſidence of paſtors / that S. Paule called Timothe &amp; Titus from Epheſus and Crete. For firſt they were Euangeliſts and no paſtors / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 12. Tit. 3. 12.</note> they went not of their owne heads / but called of the apoſtle whych was a cheefe gouernor of the churche. And thirdly they went not / but hauing other ſufficient put in their place / as it appeareth in their ſeuerall Epiſtles / ſo that if that place make any thing / it maketh not to proue the non reſidencie / but rather whether a miniſter may be tranſlated from one church to an other.</p>
               <p>But I will neuer wearye my penne to confute thoſe / whome their owne conſciences are to ſtrong for / and confuteth euery night when they go to bed: for that were nothing elſe / but to reaſon with the belly / that hath no eares to heare / or with the backe / that hathe no eyes to ſee. Thoſe that thinke that they hauing charges of their owne / yet may goe from place to place where they thinke it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary / and that it ſkilleth not where they preache / ſo they preach: muſt conſider that if they thincke that God is the author of their placing in their flockes / then that either their abode there / is nedeful and expedient / or elſe that God did not ſee
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21261:36"/> well and clearely / what was meete to be done in placing them ouer that congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation / and appoynting that that congregation ſhoulde hang and depende vppon them / for their nouriſhment and good gouernement.</p>
               <p>And you ſee that if I wold folow thoſe noble metaphores of watchman &amp; ſhephard / whych the ſcripture vſeth to expres the office of a miniſter with / what a large field is opened vnto me. For then I could ſhew you how that cities beſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged / and flockes in danger of the wolues / are * watched continually night &amp; day. <note place="margin">Luke. 2. 8.</note> And that there is no citye ſo ſore / and ſo continually beſieged / nor no flockes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ſo manifold diſeaſes at home / or hurtfull and deuouring beaſtes abrode / &amp; that wythout any truce or intermiſſion / as are the churches / the ſhepheards and watchmen wherof / are paſtors or byſhops. But I wil leaue that to their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations / and will ſhew that the partes and dueties of the miniſter be ſuche and ſo many in hys owne flocke / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> if he were as wiſe as Salomon was / as great in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel as Ioſeph / as wel learned as ſ. Paul / as actiue as Ioſue / whych fought ſo many battels in ſmall ſpace / yet all were little enough / or too little / to performe to the full / that whych his charge requireth of hym. Of the paſtors therefore is required / not only the preaching of the word / and miniſtring of the ſacraments / wherof / the preaching of the word / and miniſtring of the ſacrament of baptiſme / ought to be continually / and as oft as the church may conueniently aſſemble / the other ſacrament of the Lord his ſupper / although not ſo continually (for that the church ſhall hardly haue ſo much leifure from their neceſſary affaires of this life / as that they may celebrate it as often as the other) yet ſo often / as that we reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that too rare and ſeldome celebrating it / argueth a minde too too muche for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of the vnſpeakeable benefite of our redemption / and argueth alſo that we are farre behinde the primitiue church in zeale whych did celebrate it euery Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both: I ſay beſide the preaching of the word / and miniſtring of the ſacraments / there is required of him that he ſhoulde admoniſhe priuately / and houſe by houſe <note place="margin">20. Actes. 20.</note> thoſe that are vnder hys charge. Nowe tell me howe this can be done profitably wythoute a diligent marking / and loking into their manners? Howe can eyther publike preachings / or priuate admonitions haue their effect and working / onles the worde of God be applied according to the diſpoſition or ſtate of that people / vnto whych it is preached? and vndoubtedly heereof it commeth that the word of God is no more effectuall in this realme then it is / for becauſe it is preached hand ouer head wythout knowledge and vnderſtanding the eſtate of the people. For ſo / often times the promiſes and glad tidings of the goſpell of oure ſauioure are preached vnto thoſe / that being before ſecure in their ſinnes / are after the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the promiſes / rocked into a deade ſleepe of them / and they that are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne wyth the conſcience of their ſinne / and confounded in them ſelues / are by the ſharpneſſe of the lawe / and hearing of the iudgement of God broken into peeces / and driuen to deſperation. And ſo likewyſe / the people are taught ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times howe to lead their liues in honeſt conuerſation / when all that doctrine fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d becauſe they haue no knowledge of Chriſt / nor of faith in him: and to be ſhort / it is as much as if eyther the ſurgeon ſhoulde apply hys plaiſter / or the Phiſition his medicine / when they neither know of the wounde or diſeaſe of their pacients. But this knowledge of their eſtate / can not be without a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall abode amongſt them / therfore a continuall reſidence is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Moreouer / as in the lawe the prieſtes were ready in the temple to anſwere <note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 9.</note> all the doubtes and queſtions that any of the people ſhoulde come to aſke: ſo the miniſters in their ſeuerall pariſhes ſhuld be ready to diſſolue the difficulties that either one hathe wyth an other / or wyth him ſelfe / touching the conſcience / for want whereof / the conſciences of many / after doubtfull and daungerous wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wyth the deuill / and wyth deſpaire are ſtrangled. And thervpon ſome hang or drowne themſelues / ſome other putting away all care or conſcience of ſinning / 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21261:36"/> and labouring to haue no ſenſe nor ſeeling of their ſinne / cloſe vp the wound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healed / whych after / either breaketh oute more daungerouſly / or elſe euery daye more and more waxing ſenſeles / and wythoute feeling / treaſure vp vnto them ſelues the wrath of God againſt the day of iudgement. For although the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God dothe not for the time followe them ſo harde / as them whyche throughe terror of conſcience vntaughte and vncomforted / kill them ſelues: yet their eſtate is neuer the les daungerous therefore / but rather more / for as muche as by a longer line of ſinne drawne out / they alſo pull vpon them ſelues a heauier condemnation. Whych things when they ſee oftentimes before their eyes that will conſider it / it is eaſie to iudge that it commeth to paſſe a great deale oftner then we can ſee. When as therfore the only preaching of the worde of God being continuall / is a bonde ſtrong enoughe to holde the paſtor to hys flocke. Then the enquirie of the manners and behauioure of hys flocke / the priuate admonitions and conſolations / the diſſoluing of doubtes when anye riſeth / as a three or foure folde corde ought much more to holde him: ſo that he whych ſhall breake all theſe thyngs willingly and wittingly / can not eaſely be thoughte to breake them as Sampſon did hys by the ſtrengthe of God / but rather by ſome other power not of God. Beſides that / S. Paule commaundeth that the paſtor ſhoulde be a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 12.</note> or example in all goodnes / and holines of life vnto hys flocke / and oure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure Chriſt * ſayth that when the ſhepheard hath led forth hys ſhepe / he goeth <note place="margin">Iohn. 10. 4.</note> before them / but if the paſtoure be not amongſt hys flocke / and haue not hys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation there / they can not followe hym: If they haue not the example before their eyes / they can not make the like vnto it: Therefore this commaundement alſo bindeth them to reſidence amongſte their flockes. S. Peter willeth the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 2.</note> of the churches / that they ſhuld feede the flockes. What flockes? not euery one / but thoſe whych are committed to their faithe or truſte / or whych dependeth vpon them. And S. Paule ſpeaking to the miniſters or byſhoppes of Epheſus / <note place="margin">20. Actes. 28.</note> willeth them that they ſhould take heede vnto the flockes / ouer the which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſte had made them ouerſeers / where he reſtraineth as S. Peter did their ouerſight and watche vnto their perticulare flocke. S. Paule ſayth that he toke <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 2. 17.</note> it heauely / that he was ſeperated from them but a ſmall time / if therfore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was away wyth greefe from them whome he had taught / whome his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling compelled to be away from / and would not ſuffer to be alwayes there: what ſhall be thoughte of the paſtors / whoſe calling is to be wyth their flockes / and whych are conſecrated vnto them / euen as the Apoſtles were vnto the whole worlde / what I ſay ſhall be thought of them that are away moneths and yeres. And in deede thoſe that feede their flockes faithfully according to the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God / do ſee what a great wiſedom and mercy of God it is to appoynt euery flocke his paſtor / and euery paſtor his flocke. They can tell of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full loue that God worketh in them towardes their flockes / and in their flockes towardes them. A great encouragement vnto them / and as it were a pricke to ſtirre vp their dulnes it is / when they ſee the bleſſing of God vppon their labors / and thereof a maruellous care and thoughte to turne all ſuche thyngs away / as ſhould hinder the encreaſe of that bleſſing / which they can not haue any feeling or experience of / whych are not conuerſante wyth their flockes. Beſides this / a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie betweene the paſtor and the flocke is profitable / that they maye be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened to come and demaunde to be ſatiſfyed of thoſe thyngs they doubte of / whych they will neuer doe vnto thoſe / whome they are not by continuall conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation acquainted wyth. And it is not nothing / that Ariſtotle diſputeth agaynſte Plato his communitie / which woulde haue all things common / and that all men indifferently ſhoulde haue care of all things / and ſhoulde haue nothing whych he ſhould ſay to be hys owne. For therein Ariſtotle ſayd very well / that that which was cared for of all men / was neglected of all / and cared for of none / ſo that the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21261:37"/> preſeruation of wife or children / or of any other poſſeſſion / was then the beſt and ſureſt / when as euery man had a certaine poſſeſſion committed vnto him / which he ſhould care for / and take charge of. And ſo the Lord his wiſdome was for the better ſuretie and ſaluation of hys churche / not to make many miniſters whych ſhould in common and indifferently take care of all / but ordained that the church ſhould be deuided into diuers partes / and that euery one ſhoulde haue a peece to care for / and to giue accompte for.</p>
               <p>Nowe if any man will ſay / that in ſuche great ſcarcitie of paſtors / it is good that when a man hath trauelled in one place / and remoued them from ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / and brought them to beleue in God through Chriſt / to goe to an other place / and aſſay alſo to draw them from idolatrie: Firſt I vrge that whych I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore / whych is the calling wherin euery man muſt abide / and wythout y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whych no man ought to attempt any thing. Then I ſay that it is as hard a prouince / &amp; as painfull a thing vnto the paſtor / as acceptable and precious a worke vnto the Lord / to keepe thoſe whych are gotten / as to gette thoſe whych are not gotten / and that that ſaying is fulfilled heere (if in any thing elſe.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non minor eſt virtus quam quaerere parta tueri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is as great a vertue to kepe that whych is already gotten / as to haue got it.</p>
               <p>For we know that after that the deuill perceiueth / that men are pulled out of the power of darknes / into the glorious light of the goſpel / he ſweateth and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth by a thouſand meanes to deſtroy them / &amp; beſtirreth him ſelfe more then / then in the time of their ignorance / and in ſteade of that one chaine of ignorance / and want of the knowledge of god / he layeth a thouſand traps for them / to ſnare them with. So that the continuall danger that the church is in / dothe as it were ſpeake vnto the paſtor in the common prouerbe. <hi>Sparten hen claches koſma:</hi> that is / looke diligently to that charge whych thou haſte receiued. For / if the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhoulde forſake the Citie / wherevnto he is appoynted / and goe and watche in an other / where he is not called / althoughe he ſaue that / if he loſe the other / he ſhall not therefore eſcape the puniſhment of betraying the other citie / where he was placed watchman.</p>
               <p>Touching the behalfe of God &amp; his glory / if any man will ſay that they can not peariſh / which once haue beleued / and therfore thoſe may be left / and others attempted / I can ſay of thoſe that are in ignorance and blindnes / that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not peariſh that be elected / although they neuer haue the goſpel preached. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſte walke in thoſe wayes that God hathe appoynted / to bring them to ſaluation / whych is to feede them continually / and watche ouer them ſo long as they are in danger of hunger / in danger of wolues / in danger of the ennemyes / within and without / which is ſo long as the church is heere vpon the earth.</p>
               <p>Vpon all whych things I conclude / that the reſidence of the paſtor is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary / and to dout whether the paſtor ought to be reſident amongſt his flocke / is to doubt whether the watchman ſhould be in hys tower / the eye ſhoulde be in the head / or the ſoule in the body / or the ſhepheard amongſt his flocke / eſpecially where the ſheepe are continually in danger of wolues / as in the lande of Iewrie from whence thys ſimilitude or manner of ſpeache was taken / where they wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched their flockes night and day / as I obſerued before out of S. Luke.</p>
               <p>If any man will herevpon conclude / that they haue no ſpace geuen them to ſlepe / to eat / to drink. &amp;c. they are cauils / which I wil not vouchſafe to anſwer.</p>
               <p>Againe / if he wil ſay / that then they may not goe for the of the towne to doe their neceſſary buſines for their families / I deſire them in the name of God / that they abuſe not his graces / in deuiſing cloakes to couer their diſorders / but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would ſet before them the loue of Chriſt / whych ſhall be found to be ſo much as <note place="margin">21. Ihon. 15. 16. 17.</note> they ſhall ſhew themſelues diligent in continuall feeding their flockes / &amp; to feare the iudgement of God / before whome / no fained or coloured excuſe will ſtande:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21261:37"/> and ſo I truſt they will make no longer abſences / then muſt needes. And if vpon any occaſion at any time they be ſomewhat longer / that the ſame be not without the leaue of their churches whoſe they are / and which they for the Lord hys ſake ſerue / and then alſo that in ſuch rare and neceſſary abſence / they prouide them of ſome able man to teach in the meane ſeaſon / which the church by her gouernoures / will allow of.</p>
               <p>And heereupon alſo / is ended an other queſtion that the anſwerer maketh / whether one may haue many flockes / which is / whether one ſhepheard may bee many ſhepheards / one watcheman / many watchmen. For if his reſidence be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in one place / then he ought to content him ſelfe with one.</p>
               <p>And whereas you would haue men charitably iudge of thoſe which take many lyuinges: ſurely / if ſo be that he taketh many flockes / not to the intent to haue more lyuing to mayntaine an ambitious pompe / or to ſatiſfie a greedy deſire / of hauing more then enough / but to thys end y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he may bring in a more plentifull harneſt vnto the Lorde: it were good that he would be content to take but that lyuing of all hys flockes / which he now hath of one / eſpecially where one is able to keepe and maintayne hym and hys family honeſtly. Elſe let hym heare what councels / &amp; others / haue thought of thoſe / which haue more benefices then one.</p>
               <p>In the. 15. Canon of the councell of Nice it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded / that no clearke ſhould be placed in two Churches / and he addeth the reaſons / whereof the firſt is / that it is a poynt of marchaundiſe / and of filthy gayne. The ſeconde / that <note n="*" place="margin">Math. 6. 24. 1. Cor. 7. 24.</note> no man can ſerue two maiſters. The thirde / that euery one ought to * tary in that calling / wherein he is called.</p>
               <p>And in the ſeconde Tome of the Councelles / Damaſus in hys fourth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle / lykeneth thoſe that ſet ouer their charges vnto other / vnto harlots / whiche aſſone as they haue brought forth their children / by and by geue them to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed of others / to the intent that they might the ſoner fulfill their inordynare luſtes.</p>
               <p>Whether it were better y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> one dyligent paſtoure ſhould haue many flockes / then a neglygent and vnſkilfull paſtor one / is not the queſtion: for we ſay neither is lawfull / nor ought to be done.</p>
               <p>Doe you beleeue that which you ſette down of Denys the monke &amp; Pope / that he deuiſed and deuided pariſhes? If you doe not / why would you haue vs beeleeue it? If the law doth condemne hym / that turneth a blynde man out of <note place="margin">Deut. 27. 18.</note> the way / or layeth a blocke before hym / what doth it hym / which would put out the eyes of them that ſee their way already? I haue ſhewed / and the matter is playne / that the Lorde deuyded nationall churches / into pariſhes and congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: ſo that if S.

And thoſe that haue redde ſtoryes / know that <hi>dioiceris</hi> (which we call a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe / and which contayneth with vs numbers of pariſhes) was at the firſt taken to be the ſame that pariſhe is / and vſed a great while before Denys was borne / or monkery begotten.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Coemeteria</hi> or Churchyardes / if you meane thoſe places that lye nexte rounde about the churches / as they came in with the monke / they mighte well haue gone out with him / for any profite eyther to the church / or common wealth cometh by them.

               <p>IF you ſhoulde begette / and be a father of many bookes / and all your children like their eldeſt brother / you woulde (without better aduiſe) ſhake manye groundes of our religion. For heere agayne you wyſhe that all paſtors were able to teache / but that being vnpoſſible (as the eſtate is nowe) you are content with paſtors or miniſters that can doe nothing but reade. You through out your whole booke make thys a maruellous good eſtate / and alwayes turne the beſt ſide outwarde / and when men goe about to vrge the deformities thereof / to the ende they mighte be remedyed / then you lay open the ſhame and nakedneſſe of it / and make it greater then it is in deede. For as I haue ſhewed before / the churche ſtandeth not ſo muche in neede of youre reading miniſters / as you would make the worlde beleeue. And althoughe it be a great deformitie and ſore plage of the church which you heere ſpeake of and confeſſe at vnwares / yet you will let no man come neare to heale it. There be ſome make a gayne by ſores / and ſore legges / and therefore they haue a medicine to keepe their woundes alwayes greene / that they ſhoulde not heale.</p>
               <p>I hope you do not of purpoſe keepe the churche in this eſtate / but thys I dare ſay / that the cheefe of your gaine and of your honour conſiſteth and is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ruines of the church / and therefore I deſire you to looke vnto it.</p>
               <p>But what if the eſtate of the churche be ſuch as you ſpeake of / that it will ſkarce yelde three preaching paſtors and biſhops in ſome dioceſſe / may you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make reading miniſters? In deede if the Apoſtle had made this a counſell only / and no commaundement / that paſtors of churches ſhould be able to teache / then your ſaying might haue bene borne.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing that S. Paule hathe commaunded expreſſedly / that he ſhould <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2. Tit. 1. 9.</note> bee able to teache / and to conuince the gayneſayers / I woulde learne of you gladly / what neceſſitie there is whiche can cauſe a man to breake the morall law of God / to bring in a tradytion of man. You maye as well breake any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God for neceſſyties ſake / as breake thys / being comprehended in the firſt table.</p>
               <p>And to ſay that theſe that can only read / muſt be tolerated in the churche as miniſters / is to ſaye / becauſe you can haue no paſtors in the churches / you will haue idolles. For ſo will I not doubt to call them / although through ignoraunce of that which they do / ſome may be good men. But yet in reſpect of the place that they occupy / they are idolles / for they ſtande for that / and make ſhew of that / which they are not / and admit you them as often as you will / the Lord pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that they ſhall be no miniſters to him / which haue <note n="*" place="margin">Ozee. 4. 6.</note> no knowledge.</p>
               <p>But let vs heare your reaſon / there muſte bee reading in the churche / therefore there muſt bee miniſters whiche can doe nothing elſe. Then we may reaſon thus to. There muſt be breaking of bread / and diſtributing of the cuppe in the church / and pouring on water / therefore whoſoeuer is able to breake a loafe of bread / or to lift a cup of wyne / or to poure on water on the body of the childe / may be made a miniſter.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:21261:38"/>
               <p> And did you neuer reade that there were readers in the church / when there were no reading miniſters? but of reading of the ſcriptures and prayers in the church / there will be a fitter place to ſpeake afterwarde where it ſhall be ſhewed / how vniuſtly you ſurmiſe theſe thinges of them.</p>
               <p>Touching Homilies ſhall be ſpoken more hereafter / where further occaſion is geuen. I doe not vſe to maintayne the places which are quoted / althoughe they be truely alleaged for the cauſes which I haue before mentioned / but yet I can not but ſpeake of this place of S. Luke / for feare of the daunger that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. <note place="margin">9. Luk. 2.</note> For if thys be a good reaſon / that the place of S. Luke may not be vſed to proue that preaching is perpetually annexed to the miniſterie / becauſe in the ſame place is made mention of curing of diſeaſes / which is but a temporall thing / and followed the miniſterie but for a tyme / then the commaundement of S. Iames <note n="*" place="margin">Iam. 5. 14.</note> that the Elders of the Churche ſhoulde praye for thoſe that are ſicke / is now no commaundement / becauſe putting on of handes / and annoynting of them / that they myghte recouer theyr healthe / hathe no place / and by thys meanes you will pull from vs many places of the new Teſtament / as you dyd before of the olde.</p>
               <p>What dealing is this / to bring men into ſuſpition of that / which they neuer thought of / as though there were any woorde that ſounded to this / that a man ſhould put him ſelfe into the office of preaching / without the approbation of thoſe men to whome it doth pertayne.</p>
               <p>Their complaynt is / that thoſe which are ordayned paſtors / and therefore to preach / can not doe it without further licence. As if a man ſhould be charged to doe a thing forthwith / and then he that chargeth hym / bindeth him hande and foote / that he can not doe it / vnles he will loſe hym.</p>
               <p>The Byſhoppes inhable hym to teache / and poynte hym a place to teache in / and yet they will not let hym teache / vnleſſe he haue a further licence. If hee be an hereticke or ſchiſmatike / or ſuſpected of any ſuche thing / why is he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted / or being admitted / why is he ſuffered to be ſo much as a reader in the church? And becauſe you could not anſwere thys / therefore you ſet vp a fanſie of youres to confute. And thus you fyght without an aduerſary / and you make triumphes / where there is no victory.</p>
               <p>They will ſay vnto you / that not only vnder a godly Magiſtrate / but not in the time of perſecution any man ought to take vpon him any function in the church / vnles he be thereunto called by men / except he haue a wonderfull calling / which is rare / and muſt be diligently examyned by them which haue it / leaſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of the ſpirite of God whome they make author of their calling / it fall out that it be but their own headlong affection that hath thruſt them in: ſo farre they are from the frenſic of Anabaptiſtes / whiche you by a confutation of that / which they neuer affirmed / would ſeeme to ſtaine them with.</p>

But let theſe goe. You ſay our ſauioure Chriſt had a ſeuerall <note place="margin">Iohn. 19. 23.</note> apparell / becauſe he had a coate wythout ſeame. Aſſuredly you myghte vſe les ſcornefulnes in rehearſing of other mennes arguments / if for no other cauſe / yet for thys / that they might take more pitie of youres.</p>
               <p>For what an argument is this? Our ſauioure Chriſt did weare an vnder garment / whych coulde not be well parted / but with the ſpoile or marring of it / therfore he ware a ſeuerall apparell from the reſt. It is true / Ihon Baptiſt had <note place="margin">Math. 3. 4. 2. Reg. 1. 8.</note> a ſeuerall apparell / and to helpe you / ſo had Elias / but to thys ende / that bothe by hys vnwonted apparell / and ſtraunge diet whych he vſed of locuſtes and wilde hony / the extraordinaries of his miniſterie might be ſet forthe / and the people the rather moued to enquire of hys office / whome they ſaw to vary ſo much from the common cuſtome of other men. But miniſters now haue no ſuche extraordinarie functions / therfore by that reaſon of youres / they ſhuld not be ſeuered from other men / by any note of apparell. You ſay you knowe that the cheefe notes of a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter / are doctrine and learning / if you meane that the diſtinction of apparell muſt ſupply the reſt / and that that alſo hath ſome force to commend their miniſtery / the prophets and apoſtles of our ſauior Chriſte / left vs no perfect paterne of a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter / nor no ſufficient glas to dres him by / wherof the moſte parte neuer vſed any ſuche ſeuerall apparell / and none of them haue left any commaundement of it.</p>
               <p>For want of ſtore / and to make a long boke / heere is S. Iohns miter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed thriſe in one leafe to the ſame purpoſe / and in the ſame wordes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not enough that M. Bullinger / and M. Martyr ſhould ſpeake of them / you haue preuented them both / leaſt you ſhuld haue ſemed to haue brought nothing. If this be not Coleworts twiſe ſodden / I can not tell what is.</p>
               <p>You aſke whether the chriſtian magiſtrate may enioyne a ſeuerall kinde of apparell to the miniſters. Either the cauſe is too weake whych you defende / or elſe it hath gotten an euill patron / whych would ſo gladly ſhift it / and chaunge it with an other. For this is an other queſtion which you ſpeake of. For although that be graunted vnto you / whych you demaunde / yet you can not conclude your cauſe. For all be it the magiſtrate may commaunde a ſeuerall apparell / yet it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that he may commaund this kinde of popiſhe apparell / and therefore what manner of argument is this of youres / the magiſtrate maye commaunde a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21261:40"/> ſeuerall apparell / therfore he may commaunde this. The colledge walles will tell you / that a man can not conclude from the whole to the parte affirmatiuely. So you ſee I might let you fiſh / and catch nothing / but I am neyther afrayde / nor aſhamed / to tell you the truth of that you aſke / ſo farreforth at leaſt as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded. I thincke therefore it may be ſuch a kinde of apparell / as the magiſtrate commaunding it / the miniſter may refuſe it / and ſuch it may be / as he may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it. But whatſoeuer apparell it be / this commaundement can not be without ſome iniury done to the miniſter. For ſeeing that the magiſtrate doth allow of him / as of a wiſe / learned / and diſcrete man / and truſteth him with the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his people in matters betwene God and them / it were ſomewhat harde not to truſt him with the appoynting of his owne apparell / and he is probably to be ſuppoſed that he hath diſcretion to weare his owne geare comely / and in order / that is able to teach others / how they ſhould weare theirs? and that he ſhould be able to doe that by his wiſdome / and learning / that others do without learning and great ſtore of wiſedome / &amp; that he ſhould keepe order and decencie in apparel / which hath learned in the ſchole of Chriſt / which they doe that had neuer other ſcholemaſter / then common ſenſe and reaſon? And if any miniſter be founde to fault / in going either diſſolutely / or to exquiſitely and delicately / then the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may puniſhe him according to the diſorder wherein he faulteth.</p>
               <p>And whereas you would proue that it may be done with the miniſters / as it is done with Iudges / ſergeants / Aldermen and Sheriffes / the caſe is not like. For as for theſe which be in office / their robes and gownes may as their maces &amp; ſwordes / ſomewhat helpe to ſet forth the maieſtie and moderate pompe which is meete for the offices of iuſtice which they execute / and conſequently to helpe to ſtrike a profitable feare into their heartes which are vnderneath them / which hath / nor can haue no place in the miniſter / whoſe authoritie and power / as it is not outwarde / ſo can it not / nor ought not to borow any credite of theſe externall ſhewes. And the Magiſtrate / or the Citie / may ſeeke ſome honor of the citizens / muſtering as it were by numbers in one liuerie / which ought not to be loked for at the miniſters hand / becauſe he honoureth and ſerueth the magiſtrate an other way / nor can not alſo / conſidering that they are ſcattered through all the land in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery towne one / or not ſo many / as being put in one liuery / would make any great ſhew to the honor &amp; commendation of the towne or citie where they remaine.</p>
               <p>And ſo you ſee your queſtion anſwered / whereby appeareth they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes as other are / and to obay alſo ſometimes / where the commaundement is not geuen vpon good grounds. The place of Theodoret cited of M. Bullinger / maketh mention of a golden cope / and that vſed by byſhops of Ieruſalem / and ſolde by Cyrill a good biſhop / whereby he declared ſufficiently his miſliking of ſuch garments in the miniſterie of the ſacramentes. In the place the which hee citeth out of Socrates / there is one Sycinius an Nouatian biſhop which is ſayd to haue worne white apparell / and therefore is reprehended as for to muche exquiſiteneſſe &amp; fineneſſe of apparell / &amp; the B. of Dureſine / in a letter he wrote / alledgeth the ſame place agaynſt the ſurplice. A man would hardly beleue that maiſter Bullinger ſhoulde vſe theſe places to proue a diſtinction of apparell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the miniſters. We are not ignorant but that a cloke hath bene vſed of the miniſters in theyr ſeruice / but that was no ſeuerall apparell of the miniſters / but common to all the Chriſtians / which with change of their religion / changed alſo their apparell / as appeareth manifeſtly in Tertullian <hi>de pallio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Petalum</hi> that S. Iohn ware / I ſee not how it can bee proued / to be like a biſhops miter. For the cap / that S. Cyprian gaue the executioner / argueth rather that it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apparell which was cuſtomably worne / for elſe it would not haue done him ſo much good. As for his vpper garment which hee gaue to hys deacon / it was a token of his good will / which he would leaue
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21261:40"/> with him / as the practiſe hath bene ſeene with vs / and proueth nothing that it was any ſeuerall apparell. As for the white linnen garment which he ſuffered in / it can not ſeme ſtrange vnto vs which haue ſene the holy martyrs of the Lord executed in Smithfield and other places. And it is not to be thought that S. Cyprian had ſo ſmall iudgement / that lyuing in the time of perſecution / he would by wearing of ſome notable apparell from the reſt / as it weare betray him ſelfe into the handes of his enemies / vnles all the chriſtians had done ſo too for clearer and more open profeſſion of theyr fayth / and greater deteſtation of the contrary religion: as Tertullian and the chriſtians in his time did / by the wearing of a cloke / which reaſon may be alſo alledged of the <hi>Petalum</hi> of S.

                  </note> Chryſoſtome maketh mention of a white garment / but not in commendation of it / but rather to the contrary. For he ſheweth that the dignitie of their miniſterie / their ſafetie and crowne was in taking heede / that none vnmeete were admitted to the Lordes ſupper / not in going about the church with a white garment. And it is eaſely to be ſeene by * Salomon in his Eccleſiaſtes / that to weare a white <note place="margin">Eccle. 9. 8.</note> garment / was greatly eſtemed in the Eaſt partes / and was ordinarie to thoſe that were in any eſtimation / as the wearing of blacke with vs: and therfore was no ſeuerall apparell for the miniſters / or for to execute their miniſterie in.</p>
               <p>The reaſons that M. Peter Martyr vſeth / are the ſame before / and how he hath alſo condemned them / it ſhall appeare / with M. Bucers iudgement of theſe thinges in the ende of the booke.</p>
               <p>As for Euſtathius his depriuation / becauſe he did not weare apparel meete for a miniſter / it maketh not to this purpoſe one whit. For I haue ſhewed that if any miniſter go like a ruffian or ſwaſhe buckler / or in the brauerie of a courtier / that it is meete he ſhould be puniſhed according to the quaintitie of the fault. And that it is ſo to be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded / it appeareth manifeſtly by the councell of Gangris / which did therfore confirme the ſame depoſing / becauſe he ware a ſtranger appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell / &amp; the habite of a Philoſopher / &amp; cauſed all his fellowes to do ſo. Therfore I maruell what you meane to alledge this place. It is alſo alledged of * Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus <note place="margin">

And therfore your concluſion is both vntrue &amp; vncertaine / that ſince the Apoſtles times there hath bene a diſtinct &amp; ſeuerall apparell of the miniſters from the reſt. The matter lyeth not in that whether theſe things were firſt muented by papiſtes / or being deuiſed of others / were after taken by the papiſts / but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter ſtandeth in this / that they haue bene vſed of the papiſts as notes &amp; markes and ſacraments of their abhominations.</p>
               <p>As for Auguſtin hys place / it is to be vnderſtanded of ſuch things as haue a neceſſary vſe / and therefore may not be taken away from vs by the ſuperſtition of men. For ſo we might alſo be depriued of the ſunne / which is as it were the life of the world / becauſe the ſinme hath bene worſhipped. But that S. Auguſtin <note place="margin">

And yet I would be loth to ſay eyther with you / or with Auguſtin / that it is not lawfull for a man / to make of a popiſhe ſurplice / a ſhirt for him ſelfe / or to take the gold of a cope which he hath bought / &amp; conuert it to his priuate vſe. And herein we do nothing diſagree with S.

               <p> To all theſe things that M.

And therfore in ſtead of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples / tithes / wine. &amp;c. if you woulde haue matched the ſurplice well / you ſhoulde haue ſayd ſenſors / tapers / holy bread / holy water / and ſuch like. It is true / that M. Bucer ſayeth / that it is not in the nature of any creature to be a note of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt / but yet followeth not therof / that the creature that hathe bene accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / &amp; through abuſe applied to idolatry / may be forthwith vſed as we ſhall thinke good. For neither the idolles of the Gentiles / nor the corruptions of thoſe which offered / had power to make the beefe or mutton that was offered / no good and holeſome meate for the ſuſtenaunce of man / neither cauſe that a Chriſtian man coulde not eate them as beefe and mutton / but yet either to eate it at the table of idolles before them / or elſe priuately in hys owne houſe / when there was anye weake by / that thoughte it an abhominable thing / was not lawfull: and yet the meate neuertheles the good creature of God / and whych might be receiued wyth thankes giuing / ſo the abuſe of the ſurplice and coape. &amp;c. can not cauſe / but that they may be vſed as clothe and ſilke.</p>
               <p>And wheras he ſayeth that they are chaunged / and made of notes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianitie / markes of Chriſtianitie / I ſay that they can not be chaunged ſo by any decree or commaundement / for as much as notwithſtanding that profeſſion of chaunge / the heartes of men vnto whych euery man muſt haue regarde vnto / are not chaunged. For not ſo ſoone as the magiſtrate will ſaye that theſe thyngs ſhall be from henceforthe vſed as things indifferent / forthwyth men doe vſe them ſo / but thoſe only vſe them ſo / whych haue knowledge / both the ignorant and the weake take them ſtil otherwiſe. The reſt of thoſe things whych M. Bucer / and thoſe whych M. Bullinger and Gualter bring / are all of that ſorte / wherevnto anſwere is made.</p>
               <p>Only this they adde / that if the people do abuſe and peruert theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies / they oughte to be better inſtructed / whych is a counſell not ſo conuenient / that the miniſters and paſtors whych haue ſo many neceſſary poynts to beſtowe their time on / and to informe the people of / ſhould be driuen to cutte of their time appoynted thereto / to teache them not to abuſe theſe things / which if they vſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo well / they can gaine nothing / and to take heede that they hurte not them ſelues at thoſe things / whych in their beſt eſtate do no good / eſpecially when one ſermon of the taking of them away ioyned wyth authoritie to execute it / may do more good then a thouſand ſermons wythout authoritie.</p>
               <p>Beſides that / it is abſurde / that ceremonies whych ought to be helpers to promote the doctrine / ſhoulde become lets and hinderances / whileſt the miniſter is occupied in teaching / to beware of the abuſe of them / and of ſuperſtition. And it is as muche as if one ſhould be ſet to watche a childe all day long / leaſt he hurt him ſelfe wyth the knife / when as by taking away the knife quite from hym / the daunger is auoided / and the ſeruice of the man better employed. And ſo it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth / that althoughe the churche may appoynt ceremonies and rites / yet it can not appoynte theſe that haue great incommoditye / and no commoditie / great offence and no edifying.</p>
               <p>And althoughe they haue all theſe properties whych you recite / yet if they be not to edifying / if not to God hys glorye / if not comely and agreeable to the ſimplicitie of the goſpell of Chriſte crucified / they may not be eſtabliſhed.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can you excuſe your ſelfe in ſaying that the Admonition geueth you ſo often times occaſion to ſpeake of them / and ſo to lay the faulte vpon it / for that it being wrytten by diuers perſons of the ſame matters / whereof one knewe not of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doing / can not be blamed for the repetition of one thing twiſe / when as you can not eſcape blame whych might haue gathered eaſely into one place / y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which is ſayd of them in diuers.

Wherin there is nothing but the truthe ſayde / for becauſe that was vſed but in few churches / and but of few alſo in thoſe few churches: therfore if there were cauſe to take away that / there was greater to take away the ſurplice. And to take away the Amis out of the church / and leaue the ſurplice. &amp;c. is to heale a ſcratch / and leaue a wound vnhealed.</p>
               <p>Nowe whereas you ſay / that we are alwayes <hi>(Ad oppoſitum)</hi> and that if the lawe commaunded ſtraightly / that we ſhoulde weare none of thys apparell / that then we would weare: if it ſhould be anſwered againe that you doe <hi>Seruire ſcenae:</hi> that is / that you are a time ſeruer / you ſee we mighte ſpeake wyth more likelyhoode then you.

               <p>To be ſhort (ſayth M. Doctor) when he reciteth me almoſt a whole ſide word for word / as he hath cited before / wher he hath had his anſwere. After this he ſetteth him ſelfe to proue that they edifye / and that firſt by M. Bucers / and M. Martyrs authoritye / and yet in their wordes before alledged / there is not a worde of edifying. If he gather it of their wordes / the anſwere is already made. Then he bringeth reaſons to proue it / whereof in the firſt he ſeemeth to reaſon / that becauſe it is commaunded by a lawfull magiſtrate / and lawfull authoritye / therfore it edifieth. As though a lawful magiſtrate doth nothing at any time vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully / or as thoughe a lawfull and a godly magiſtrate / dothe not ſometimes commaund things / whych are inconuement and vnlawfull. Saule was a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full magiſtrate / and did commaund vnlawfull things. Dauid was a lawfull and godly magiſtrate / and yet there ſlipt from him commaundementes / whych were neither lawfull / nor godly. But he addeth that it is done for order / and for decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie / wythout ſuperſtition / or ſuſpition of it. This is that whych is in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy / and oughte to be proued / and M. Doctor ſtill taketh it as graunted / and ſtill faulteth in the petition of the principle / wherwith he chargeth others.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is / that they that weare thys apparell / haue edified / and do edify: whych is / as if a man would ſay / the midwiues whych lied vnto Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao / did much good amongſt the Iſraelites / <hi>Ergo,</hi> their lying did much good. If <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 19.</note> he will ſay / the compariſon is not like / becauſe the one is not ſinne in hys owne nature / whereas the other is ſinne / then take thys: One that ſtammereth and ſtutteth in his to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g / edifieth the people / therfore ſtammering and ſtutting / is good to edifie. For what if the Lorde geue hys bleſſing vnto hys worde / and to other good giftes whych he hath that preacheth and weareth a ſurplice. &amp;c.

               <p>The third reaſon is / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which conſent in wearing the ſurplices / conſent alſo in all other poynts of doctrine / and they that do not weare it / do not conſent / not ſo much as amongſt them ſelues. If this conſent in the poynts of religion be in the ſurplice / cope. &amp;c. tel vs I beſeche you / whether in the matter / or in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> form / or in what hid and vnknowne quality ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it? if it be in that the miniſters vſe all one apparell / then it is maruell that this being ſo ſtrong a bond to holde them togither in godly vnitie / that it was neuer commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of Chriſt / nor practiſed of prophets or apoſtles / neuer of no other reformed churches. I had thought who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / that thoſe things which the lord appoynteth to maintaine &amp; kepe vnitie with / &amp; eſpecially the holy ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of baptiſme / &amp; of the lords ſupper / had ben ſtrong enough to haue firſt of all knit vs vnto the lord / &amp; therfore alſo to his doctrine / &amp; then one of vs to an other / &amp; that the diſſenting in ſuch a ceremony as a ſurplice. &amp;c. neither ſhould nor could in thoſe that pertaine vnto God / breake the vnitie of the ſpirit / whych is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wyth the bond of truth. And although there be whych like not this apparell / that thinke otherwiſe then either their brethren / or then in dede they ought to do / yet a man may finde greater diſſent amongſt thoſe / whych are vnited in ſurplice &amp; cope. &amp;c. then there is / amongſt thoſe which weare them not / either w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them ſelues / or w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them that weare them. For how many there are that weare ſurplices / which would be gladder to ſay a maſſe / than to heare a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon / let all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world iudge. And of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> do weare this apparel / &amp; be otherwiſe wel minded to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel / are ther not which wil wear y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſurplis / &amp; not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cap: other y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil weare both cap &amp; ſurplice / but not the tippet / &amp; yet a third ſort / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil weare ſurplice / cap / &amp; tippet / but not the cope. It hath ben the maner alwayes of wiſe &amp; learned men / to eſteme of things by the cauſes / &amp; not by the euent / &amp; that eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in matters of religion / for if they ſhuld be eſtemed of the euent / who is there which wil not condemne the Iſraelites battell againſt Aye / &amp; afterward againſt <note place="margin">Ioſua. 8.

And therfore in a worde I anſwere / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> if there be ſuch conſent amongſt thoſe which like wel of this apparell / and ſuch iarres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that like it not (as M. doctor wold make the world beleue) neither is the wearing of the ſurplice. &amp;c. cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſent in them / nor the not wearing cauſe of the diſagrement in the other. But as our knowledge &amp; loue is vnperfect here in this world / ſo is our agrement &amp; conſent of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnperfect. And yet all theſe harde ſpeaches of yours / or vncharitable ſuſpitions of papiſme / anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme / cathariſine / donatiſme. &amp;c. wherby you do as much (as lieth in you) to cut vs cleane of from you / ſhal not be able ſo to eſtrange vs or ſeperate vs from you / but that we wil by gods grace hold / what ſo euer you hold well / &amp; kepe that vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſpirit / which is the bond of truth / eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with you M. doctor / whom we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as appeareth by this your boke / to haue ſet your ſelfe further from vs / then numbers of thoſe / which although they be content to receiue the apparel / &amp; beare w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> things / yet wold haue ben loth to haue ſet downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> againſt the ſinceritie of the goſpel / &amp; hinderance of reformation / which you haue done. The white apparell / which is a note &amp; true repreſentation of the glory &amp; purenes in the angels / ſhuld <note place="margin">Act. 1. 10.</note> be a lying ſigne / &amp; prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters / which are miſerable / &amp; ſinful men. And our ſauior Chriſt / which was the miniſter of God / &amp; pure from ſin / &amp; therfore meteſt to weare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marke of purenes / vſed no ſuch kinde of weede / ſauing only for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſmal time / wherin he wold geue to his diſciples in the mount / a taſt of that glory which he ſhuld enioy for euer / &amp; they with him: where / for the time his apparel appeared as white as ſnow. And if it be mete that the miniſters <note place="margin">Mark. 9. 3.</note> ſhuld repreſent the angels in their apparel / it is much more mete / that they ſhuld haue a paire of wings as the angels are deſcribed to haue / to put them in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance <note place="margin">Iſay. 6. 2.</note> of their readines &amp; quicknes to execute their office / which may and ought to be in them / then to weare white apparell / whych is a token of purenes from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21261:43"/> ſinne and infection / and of a glorye whych neither they haue / nor can haue / nor ought ſo much as to deſire to haue / as long as they be in thys world.</p>
               <p>And whereas the maintainers of this apparell / haue for their greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence / that it is a thyng meere ciuill: to let paſſe / that they confounde Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call orders wyth ciuill (whych they can no more iuſtly do / then to confounde the church wyth the common wealth) I ſay to let that pas / they do by thys meanes not only make it an Eccleſiaſtical ceremonie / but alſo a matter of conſcience. For if ſo be that the white apparell of the miniſter haue any force / either to moue the people / or the miniſter vnto greater purenes / or to any other godlynes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer / then it is that whych ought to be commaunded / and to be obeyed of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty / and to be retained / althoughe the contrarye were forbidden. And then alſo if there be a vertue in a white garment / and the ſignification therof be ſo ſtrong to worke godlynes / it were meete that order were taken / that the whiteſt clothe ſhould be bought / that it ſhould be often (at the leaſt euery weeke once) waſhed by a very good launder / and wyth ſope: for if the white helpe / more white hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth more / and that whych is moſte white / helpeth moſte of all to godlynes. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the church haue authoritye to make ceremonies (ſo they be according to the rules before recited of Gods glory / and profiting the congregation) I coulde for all that neuer yet learne / that it had power to giue newe ſignifications / as it were to inſtitute newe ſacramentes. And by this meanes is taken cleane awaye from vs / the holde whych we haue againſt the papiſtes / whereby (againſt all the goodly ſhewes whych they make by the coloure of theſe ſignifications) we ſay / that the word of God / and the ſacramentes / of baptiſme / and of the ſupper of the Lord / are ſufficient to teache / to admoniſhe / and to put vs in remembrance of all duetye whatſoeuer. So we are nowe come to the ſuperſtition of the Grecians / for as they will haue neyther grauen / nor carued image in their Churches / but painted / ſo we wil nether haue grauen / nor carued / nor painted / but woue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And truely I ſee no cauſe / why we may not haue as wel holy water &amp; holy bread / if this reaſon whych is here / be good: for I am ſure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſignifications of them are as gloryous as this of the ſurplice / and call to remembraunce as neceſſarye things. And if it be ſayde / that it maye not be / leaſt the number of ceremonies ſhoulde be to too great / it may be eaſely anſweared / that theſe whych we haue may be taken away / and thoſe ſet in place of them. And therefore althoughe the ſurplice haue a blacke ſpot / when it is whiteſt / yet is it not ſo blacke as you make it wyth your white ſignifications / nor the cauſe ſo euill as you defend it. If you pres me with M. Martyrs / and M. Bucers authoritye / I firſt ſay they were men / &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (although otherwiſe very watchfull) yet ſuch as ſlept ſome times. And then I appeale from their Apocryphas / vnto their knowne wrytings / and from their priuate letters / vnto their publike recordes. M. Doctor proceedeth to proue that they are ſignes and ſhewes of good / and not of euill / as the authors of the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition alleage. To the proufe wherof / although (according to his manner) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth diuers things before alleaged / yet the ſumme of all he hath comprehended in an argument / whych is / that for ſo muche as the miniſters are good whych weare them / therfore they are alſo good: and becauſe the miniſters whereof the apparell are notes / and markes be good: therefore thoſe be good notes and good markes: ſo the reaſon is they are notes / and notes of good miniſters / therefore they be good notes of the miniſters. So I will proue the names of idolles / to be fit and conuenient names for good men to be called by. Beltſhaſer / Shaddrake / <note place="margin">Daniel. 1. 7.</note> Miſacke / and Abed-nego were names of Daniell and hys three companions / and they were the names of good men / therefore they are good names of men. And ſo the names of the Babylonian Idols / are by thys reaſon of M. Doctor / iuſtified to be good names. Again / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> golden calfe was a ſigne. Alſo it was a ſigne of the true God: therefore it was a true ſigne of God. Concerning the notes of <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 4.</note>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:21261:43"/> ciuill profeſſions / and what difference is betweene thoſe and thys cauſe / I haue ſpoken before.</p>
               <p>You ſay the cauſe of diſcorde is not in the apparell / but in the mindes of men. You meane I am ſure / thoſe that refuſe the apparell / but if you make them authors of diſcord / becauſe they conſent not wyth you in wearing / do you not ſee it is as ſoone ſayde / that you are the cauſers of diſcorde / becauſe you doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wyth thoſe whych were not? for as there ſhould be vnitie in that poynte / if all did weare that apparell / ſo ſhould there be / if all did weare none of it. It is a very vnequall compariſon that you compare the vſe of thys apparell / wyth the vſe of wine / and of a ſworde / whych are profitable and neceſſary / but it is more intollerable / that you match it wyth the word of God. I could throwe it as farre downe / as you lifte it vp / but I will not doe ſo. Thys only I will ſaye / if there were no harme in it / and that it were alſo profitable / yet for as much as it is not commaunded of God expreſly / but a thing (as you ſay) indifferent / and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is cauſe of ſo many incommodities / and ſo abuſed (as I haue before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) it ought to be ſufficient reaſon to aboliſh them: ſeing that the braſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <note place="margin">Nom. 21. 8. 9. 2. Reg. 18. 4.</note> whych was inſtituted of the Lorde him ſelfe / and contained a profitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the wonderfull benefite of God towardes hys people was beaten to pouder / when as it began to be an occaſion of falling vnto the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: and ſeeing that S. Paule after the loue feaſtes (whych were kepte at the adminiſtration of the Lords ſupper / and were meanes to nouriſhe loue amongſt <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 22.</note> the churches) were abuſed &amp; drawne to an other vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were firſt ordained, did vtterly take them away / &amp; commaund that they ſhuld not be vſed any more.</p>
               <p>The reſt of that whych followeth in this matter / is nothing elſe / but either that whych hath bene often times repeated / or elſe reprochefull words / or vniuſt accuſations of contempt of magiſtrates / wythout any proufe at all / and therfore are ſuche / as eyther are anſwered / or whych I will not voutchſafe to anſwere / eſpecially ſeeing that I meane not to giue reproche for reproche / and reuiling for reuiling: and ſeeing that I haue before proteſted of our humble ſubmiſſion / and louing feare or reuerence / whych we beare to the Prince / and thoſe whych are appoynted magiſtrates vnderneathe her.</p>
               <p>And therfore I will conclude / that for ſo muche as the ceremonies of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianitie / are not / nor can not be / the fitteſt to ſette forthe the goſpell / and for that they are occaſions of fall to ſome / of hinderance to other ſome / of griefe and alienation of mindes vnto others (the contrary of all which / ought to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in eſtabliſhing of things indifferent in the churche) therefore neyther is thys apparell fitteſt for the miniſter of the goſpell / and if it were / yet conſidering the incommodities that come of the vſe of it / it ſhould be remoued.</p>

               <p>OF theſe offices ſome thing hath bene ſpoken before / where it hath bene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of the words of Chriſt / that neither the names / nor offices of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop / or Archdeacons doe agree to the miniſterie of the goſpell. Nowe as M.

               <p>And for the names firſt / I deſire the reader that we be not thought ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of contention / becauſe we ſtriue about the name of Archbyſhop. &amp;c. for thys is not to ſtriue about words / vnles it be counted a ſtrife of wordes / which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the maintenance of the worde of God / as it hathe before appeared out of the Euangeliſts. Then it muſt be remembred whych Ariſtotle ſayeth very well in hys Elenches / that <hi>ta onomata ton pragmaton mimemata eſti:</hi> whych is / that names are imitations / or as it were expres images of the things whereof they are names / and doe for the moſt part bring to hym that heareth them / knowledge of the things that are ſignified by them. Howſoeuer the thing be it ſelfe / yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it is ſuppoſed to be as the name pretendeth / and therevpon followeth / that a man may be eaſely deceiued / when the names doe not anſwer to the things wherof they are names. There may be / I graunte / a freer and more licentious vſe of names / but that licence is more tollerable in any thing / rather then in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the church and ſaluation. And if there be ſome caſes / wherin names that are not ſo proper / may be borne with / yet are there alſo whych are intollerable.

Againe / it is vnlawfull for any man to take vpon him thoſe titles which are proper to our ſauioure Chriſt: but the title of Archbyſhop is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to our ſauioure Chriſte / therefore no man may take that vnto hym. That it <note place="margin">1. Epiſt. 5. 4. Heb. 13. 20. Acts. 3. 15. Acts. 5. 31. Heb. 12. 2.</note> is proper to oure ſauioure Chriſte / appeareth by that whych S.

And in the Hebrues where he is called the great ſhepheard of the ſheepe / and in the Actes / and * Hebrues / archleader of lyfe and

               <p>And it any man will reply and ſay / that it is not ſayd that our ſauior Chriſt is only archbiſhop. I anſwer that he is not only ſayd the head / and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there is no more heads of the churche but he. And if it be further ſayde that theſe archbyſhops are but vnder / and as it were ſubordinate archbyſhops / I ſay that a man may as wel ſay that men may be alſo vnder heads of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church / whych is the ſame whych is alledged for the pope. Whych thing is not only true in thoſe wordes whych doe ſignify / and ſet vnlawfull things before our eyes / but euen in thoſe names alſo whych hauing no corruption in their owne nature / yet throughe the corrupt vſe of men / haue as it were gotten ſuche a tacke of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption / that the vſe of them can not be wythout offence.</p>
               <p>In the primitiue church / the name of a Pope was honeſt / and was all one <note place="margin">

               <p>The name of a Tyranne / was firſt honourable / and the ſame with a king / and yet through cruelty / and vniuſt rule of certaine / it is become now ſo hatefull / that no vpright and iuſt dealing Prince / none that gouerneth wyth equitye / and to the commodity of hys ſubiects / would beare to be called Tyranne: wherby it may appeare / that it is not for nought that we do ſtande of theſe names. Nowe if the names ought to be odious / being both horribly abuſed / and alſo forbidden by our ſauioure Chriſte / the thyngs them ſelues muſt be in greater hatred / the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnes wherof may thus appeare.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all / the miniſtery is by the word of God / and heauenly / and not left to the will of men to deuiſe at their pleaſure / as appeareth by that whych is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſ.

Iohn to eſtabliſh his ſingular and extraordinary function / alledgeth the word of God / wherby appeareth / that as it was not lawfull to bring in any ſtrange doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine / ſo was it not lawfull to teache the true doctrine / vnder the name of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther function then was inſtituted by God.</p>
               <p>Let the whole practiſe of the churche vnder the lawe / be loked vpon / and it ſhall not be founde that any other Eccleſiaſticall miniſtery was appoynted / then thoſe orders of highe prieſt / and prieſts / and Leuites. &amp;c. whych were appoynted by the law of God / &amp; if there were any raiſed extraordinarily / the ſame had their calling confirmed from heauen / either by ſignes or miracles / or by plaine &amp; cleare teſtimonies of the mouthe of God / or by extraordinarye exciting and mouings of the ſpirite of God. So that it appeareth that the miniſterie of the goſpell / and the functions thereof / ought to be from heauen / and of God / and not inuented by the braine of men: from heauen / I ſay / and heauenly / becauſe althoughe it be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by earthly men / &amp; the miniſters alſo are choſen by men like vnto themſelues / yet becauſe it is done by the word and inſtitution of God / that hath not only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that the word ſhould be preached / but hathe ordained alſo in what order / and by whome it ſhould be preached / it may well be accounted to come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen / and from God.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore / that theſe functions of the Archbiſhop and Archdeacon are not in the word of God / it foloweth that they are of the earth / &amp; ſo can do no good / but much harme in the church. And if any man will ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we do the church great iniurye / becauſe we doe tie her to a certaine nomber of orders of miniſters / 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21261:45"/> as it were to a ſtake / ſo that ſhe may not deuiſe new functions / I ſay that bothe the churche and Chriſt doth accuſe him againe. Chriſt eſtemeth him ſelfe to haue iniurie / becauſe that by thys meanes he is imagined not to haue bene careful / and prouident enough for hys church / in that he hath left the miniſterie / wherein doth conſiſt the life of the church (being that wherby it is begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) ſo raw and vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by permitting of it to the ordering of men / there is a great danger of error / whych he might haue ſet without all daunger / by a word or two ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>The churche of the other ſide riſeth againſt hym / for that he maketh Chriſt les carefull for her / then he was for that vnder the lawe. For tell me in the whole volume of the Teſtament is there any kinde or degre of miniſterie / wherof God is not the certen and expres author? was there euer any man (I except Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam and ſuche prophane men) either ſo holy / or ſo wiſe / or of ſuche great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge / that euer did ſo muche as dreame of inſtituting of a newe miniſterie?

               <p>All men knowe that the Arke of Noah / was a figure of the church. Noah <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 14. 22.</note> was both a wiſe and a godly man / yet what doth the Lord leaue to his wiſdom / when as he appoynteth the matter / the forme / the length / the bredth / the heigth / the woode / the kinde and ſorte of woode.</p>
               <p>In the tabernacle the church is yet more expreſſedly ſhewed forth / Moſes that was the ouerſeer of the worke / was a wiſe and a godly man / the artificers <note place="margin">Exod. 26. Exod. 31. 3. 6.</note> that wroughte it / Bezalael / and Aholiab / moſt cunning workemen / and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue / howe the Lorde leaueth nothing to their will / but telleth not onlye of the boordes / of the curtaines / of the apparell / but alſo of the barres / of the rings / of the ſtrings / of the hookes / of the beſomes / of the ſnuffers / and of the thyngs / <note place="margin">Exo. 39. 42.</note> the matter / and the forme.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to the temple / whych as it was more neare the time of Chriſt / ſo it dothe more liuely expres the churche of God / whych nowe is. Salomon the wiſeſt man that euer was or ſhall be / dothe nothing in it / neyther for the temple <note place="margin">1. Reg. 3. 12. 1. Chro. 28. 11. &amp;c. 19. 1. Reg. 6. 2. Chro. 3. 4. 5.

And in the reſtoring of that temple / Ezechiel is witnes / howe the Angell by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God doth parte by parte / appoynt all to be done bothe in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and in the furniture thereof.</p>
               <p>Nowe if the holy ghoſte in Figures and Tropes dothe ſo carefully / and as a man may ſpeake / curiouſly comprehende all things: in the truthe it ſelfe / howe muche more is it to be thought that he hath performed this? If in the ſhadowes / howe muche more in the body / if he haue done this in earthly things / and which are peariſhed / how is it to be thought that he hath not performed it in heauenly / and thoſe whych abide for euer? And then tell me what are thoſe times / of which it was ſayd / the Meſſias when he commeth / will tell vs all? Is it a like thyng <note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 25.</note> that he whych did not only appoynt the temple and the tabernacle / but the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of them / woulde not only neglecte the ornamentes of the churche / but alſo that / wythout the whych (as we are borne in hand) it can not long ſtande? ſhall we thinke that he which remembred the barres there / hathe forgotten the pillers heere? or he that there remembred the pinnes / did heere forget the maſter buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? ſhoulde he there remember the beſomes / and heere forget Archbyſhops / if any had bene needefull? there make mention of the ſnuffers to purge the lights / and heere paſſe by the lightes them ſelues?
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21261:45"/> And to conclude / that he ſhoulde make mention there of the moates / and heere ſay nothing of the beames? there recken vp the gnattes / heere keepe ſilence of the Camels? what is this elſe / but that which Ariſtotle ſayth / <hi>ta mikra horan kai ta megala paroran:</hi> that is / to looke to ſmall things / and not to looke to great / which if it can not fall into the Lorde / let it be a ſhame to ſay that the cheefe piller and vpholder of the churche / is not expreſſed in the ſcripture / nor can not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer thoſe miniſteries without the which the churche is fully buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded / and brought to perfection and complete vnitie / are not to be retayned in the churche: but with out the miniſteries of Archbiſhop. &amp;c. the churche maye bee fully builded and broughte to perfection / therefore theſe miniſteries are not to be retayned.</p>
               <p>And that without theſe miniſteries the Churche may be complete / it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by that which is in the Epheſians / where it is ſayde / that Chriſte gaue <note place="margin">4. Eph. 11. 12.</note> ſome Apoſtles / ſome Prophetes / ſome Euangeliſtes / ſome paſtors and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors / to the reſtoring of the ſayntes vnto the worke of the miniſterie / vntill wee all come to the vnitie of fayth / and of the knowledge of the ſonne of God / and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect man.</p>
               <p>The learned wryters haue thus reaſoned agaynſte the Pope: that for ſo muche as Apoſtles / Prophetes. &amp;c. are ſufficient for the building of the churche / therefore there ought to be no Pope. The argument and neceſſitie of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is as ſtrong agaynſt the Archbiſhoppe / and all one. For by the ſame reaſon that the Pope is caſt away as a ſuperfluous thing / for that theſe offyces are able to make perfect the Churche / is the Archbiſhoppe likewiſe throwne out of the Churche / as a knobbe or ſome lumpe of fleſhe / which being no member of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy / doth both burden it and diſfigure it. And as they ſay that God gaue no Pope to his church / therefore the Pope can doe no good / ſo we may well ſay / God gaue no Archbiſhop to his church / therefore the Archbiſhop can do no good.</p>
               <p>Neyther dyd God geue any archdeacon to his church / therefore he can not profite the church. But it will be ſayde that this argument followeth not / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no mention is made heere of the deacon or of the elder / which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are bothe neceſſarye in the churche / and therefore that there are functions profitable in the church / whereof no mention is made heere. But how eaſely doe all men know / that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of thoſe functions heere only / which are conuerſant in the worde / and haue to doe with the preaching thereof: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made heere no mention of the deacon or elder. It is ſayde agayne / that in the Epiſtle to the Corinth. S. Paule ſpeaketh only of Apoſtles / Prophetes / and <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 28.</note> Doctors / leauing out Euangeliſtes and paſtors / and yet Euangeliſtes and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors neceſſary / and ſo although archbiſhops are not ſpoken of in the place to the Epheſians / yet they may not be therfore ſhut out as vnneceſſary. But they that ſay ſo / ſhould haue conſidered that the diuerſitie of the matter which the Apoſtle handleth in theſe two places / bred a diuers kinde of ſpeche. For in the Epiſtle to the Corinthians / going aboute to condemne the ambition of men / which will thruſt them ſelues into other mens callings / and take vpon them to doe all them ſelues / and to be as it were / eye / and eare / and hande and all. S. Paule proueth that the churche is a body / wherein there are manye members / and the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers one from an other / and that it is not one member only. And to proue that / it was ſufficient to ſay that he placed ſome Apoſtles / ſome Prophets / ſome Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors / without rehearſing all the kindes of functions. But in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians / meaning to ſhew the liberalitie of our ſauiour Chriſt in geuing thoſe / which ſhoulde be able by doctrine and teaching to make perfect and abſolute hys church / it was neceſſary that he ſhoulde recken vp all thoſe functions / whereby that worke is done.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:21261:46"/>
               <p> But how commeth it to paſſe that S. Paule neyther in the one place / ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the other / nor elſe where / maketh mention of the archbiſhop / which is ſayd to be the cheefeſt piller and vnder ſetter of the church? Now I heare what is ſayde to this: that vnder the paſtor is contayned byſhop / he is not contayned / but is the ſame that paſtor. How then? forſoth ſay they an archbyſhop is byſhop / well then / of byſhops ſome are archbyſhops / &amp; ſome are what? Heere I ſee that they are hanged in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> buſh / but I will helpe them. Of byſhops ſome are archbyſhops / ſome are by the common name byſhops: For if they anſwere not thus / what haue they to ſay? But what an abſurd thing were that / to ſay that S. Paule compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended an archbyſhop vnder a paſtor or byſhop / which neyther was at that time / nor certayne hundreth yeares after? thys were not to deuide / but to propheſie. And how is it that they neuer marked that S. Paule ſpeaketh of thoſe functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were in the church / and not of thoſe which ſhould be afterwarde? and of thoſe that God had geuen / and not of thoſe which he would geue? for the words are / (and he hath geuen.)</p>
               <p>Moreouer if ſo be vnder the paſtor / the apoſtle comprehended an archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop / then the archbyſhop is neceſſary / and ſuch as the church can not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out / and commaunded of God / and therefore not taken vp by the pollicie of the church for the time and countrey / and other circumſtances / and ſuch alſo as can not be put downe at the will of the church / which is contrary to the iudgement of thoſe / which are the archbyſhops patrones. The laſt refuge is / that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle made mention of thoſe functions / which haue to do with the miniſtring of the word &amp; ſacraments / &amp; not of thoſe which haue to do with order &amp; diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Speake in good earneſt / had the Apoſtles nothing to doe with diſcipline &amp; order? with what face can you take away the raines of gouernment out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles hands / and put them in the Archbyſhops and Archdeacons hands? what a peruerſeneſſe is thys / that the miniſteries inuented by men / ſhould be preferred to all the miniſteries appoynted and commaunded of God.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles forſoth haue in common with the Archbyſhops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons the power of miniſtring of the worde and of the ſacraments / of binding and loſyng / and thus farre as good as the Archbyſhops and Archdeacons: But for diſciplyne and order / the Apoſtles haue nothing to doe / but herein Archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Archdeacons are aboue them / and better then they.</p>
               <p>Now ſyr / if I would follow your vaine of making ſo many exclamations / as Oh the impudencie / Oh the inſolencie / with twentie other ſuch great Ohs / you ſee I haue occaſion both heere and elſe where / but I would not gladly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame / eſpecially when I ſhould diſpute / nor make outcries in ſtead of reaſons.</p>
               <p>But to come to this diſtinction: I had thought before this time / that the apoſtles had bene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> * cheefe builders in ſetting vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church: now I perceiue you <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 10.</note> make the archbyſhops and archdeacons the cheefe builders / and the apoſtles vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der carpenters / or common maſons / to ſerue and to take the commaundement of the archbiſhop and archdeacon. And wheras it is ſayd / that the miniſters which S. Paule ſpeaketh of / are in the worde and ſacramentes / binding and looſing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / and that there be other which are beſides theſe / occupyed in the order and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplyne of the church (of which number are archbyſhops and archdeacons) let vs marke a little what deepe diuinitie heere is.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all / I would gladly aſke them / with what aduiſe they haue layde on a greater burden and waight of the archbiſhops and archdeacons ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders / then the apoſtles were able to ſuſtaine?</p>
               <p>Secondarily / I aſke with what boldneſſe / and vpon the confidence of what giftes / any man dare take vppon him both that which the apoſtles did / and more too? Then I ſay that it is too too vnſkilfully done / to ſeperate order / and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline from them that haue the miniſterie of the word in hand / as though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21261:46"/> without archbyſhops and archdeacons / were a confuſed heape / and a diſordered lumpe / when as S. Paule teacheth it to be without them / a body conſiſting of <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 4. 5.</note> all his partes and members / comely knitte and ioyned together / wherein nothing wanteth / nor nothing is too much. Doth it not pertayne to order / that the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayth / that God hath ſet firſt apoſtles / ſecondly prophets / thirdly teachers? <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 28. Colloſ. 2. 19.</note> are not theſe wordes (firſt / ſecond / third / differences of order? if this be not order / ſurely I know not what order is. And yet neyther archbyſhop nor archdeacon author of this / and it was kept alſo before they were hatched.</p>
               <p>Let vs ſee of diſciplyne and gouernment / which we may ſee to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thoſe / which haue the preaching of the word / and to others alſo which dyd not preach the worde / when S. Paule ſayth that the elders which gouerne wel / <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> are worthy double honor / eſpecially thoſe which trauaile in the word. Where he appoynteth the gouernement to the miniſters of the worde / and to thoſe alſo that were not miniſters of the worde. And thereupon it followeth / that the miniſters of the church are not ſeuered one from an other / as you ſeuer them / becauſe ſome haue the miniſtration of the worde and ſacramentes only / and ſome with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the ſacramentes and word / haue alſo the gouernement and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyne in their handes / but cleane contrariwiſe S. Paule diſtinguiſheth them / and ſheweth that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters in the church haue the gouermnent / but all haue not the worde to handle / ſo that he diſtinguiſheth the miniſterie into that / whiche is occupyed in the worde and gouernment / and into that which is occupyed in the gouernment only. But in this diſtinction you do not only forget S. Paule / but you forget your ſelfe. For if S. Paule ſpeake in that place of thoſe that meddle with the miniſtring of the word and ſacraments only: why doth the biſhop which is one of the miniſters that S. Paule ſpeaketh of (being the ſame that paſtor is) why I ſay doth he meddle with the diſcipline and order of the church / ſeeing that belongeth not to him by your diſtinction? why doth alſo the archbiſhop (whome you ſay is a biſhop) meddle with it? and thus you ſee you neede no other aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then your ſelfe / to confute you.</p>
               <p>And leaſt any man ſhoulde ſay I confute mine owne ſhadow / I muſt let hym vnderſtand that there is a pamphlet in Latine / which is called the booke of the doctors / which goeth from hande to hande / and eſpecially (ſo farre as they coulde bring to paſſe) to thoſe only that they thought to fauoure that opynion / in the which booke / all theſe anſweres vnto the place of the Epheſians are contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned / and almoſt all that which is comprehended in thys defence of archbiſhops and archdeacons / with other things alſo which are founde in this booke of M. Doctors: and therefore it is very likely / that he hauing no other way to vente hys rapſodies and rakings togither / thought he would bring them to light after thys ſorte / but how much better had it bene / that thys myſhapen thing had had the mothers wombe for the graue / or being brought out / had bene hidden as the former is / in ſome bench hole or darke place / where it ſhould neuer haue ſeene any light / nor no mans eye ſhould euer haue looked of it? And thus all theſe cloudes being ſcattered by the ſunne of truth / you ſee that the place to the Epheſians / ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtrong agaynſt the archbiſhop and archdeacon.</p>
               <p>Now will I reaſon alſo after thys ſorte out of the place of the Epheſians and Corinthyans ioyned together. There is no function but hathe giftes fitte and apte to diſcharge it / annexed and geuen vnto it: whereuppon the Apoſtle by a Metonomy / doth call the Apoſtles / Prophets. &amp;c. giftes / becauſe they haue alwayes giftes ioyned with them. Thys being graunted (as no man can deny it) I reaſon thus.</p>
               <p>Thoſe functions only are ſuffycient for the church / which haue all the gifts needefull / eyther for the myniſtring of the worde and ſacramentes / or for the gouernement of the churche: but all theſe functions reckened of S. Paule to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21261:47"/> the Epheſians / with thoſe which S. Paule calleth <hi>antilepſeis,</hi> and <hi>kyberneſeis</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 11. 1. Cor. 12. 28.</note> (which are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deacons and elders) haue the gifts needeful / eyther for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church / eyther elſe for the miniſtering of the worde and ſacramentes: therefore theſe functions only are ſufficient for the church / for it is a ſuperfluous thing to make more offices / then there be giftes to furniſh them / for ſo they that ſhoulde haue them / ſhoulde rather be idols then officers. And therefore for as much as there is no gift which falleth not into ſome of theſe functions / it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a vaine and vnprofitable thing / to bring more offices and functions into the church beſides theſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo it may be thus reaſoned. If men may make and erect new miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries / they muſt eyther geue giftes for to diſcharge them / or aſſure men that they ſhall haue giftes of God / whereby they may be able to anſwere them. But they can neyther geue giftes / nor aſſure men of any giftes neceſſary to diſcharge thoſe functions / therefore they may make or erect no new miniſteries.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all / I conclude agaynſt theſe made and deuiſed miniſteries of arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and archdeacons after this ſort. If men may adde miniſteries / they may alſo take away / for thoſe both belong to one authoritie: but they can not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thoſe miniſteries that God hath placed in his church / therefore they can not adde to thoſe that are placed in the church. And this foundation I thought firſt to lay / or euer I entred into M. Doctors not reaſons / but authorities / not of God / but of men / in confuting of which / there will fall forth alſo other arguments agaynſt both theſe offices of archbiſhop / and archdeacon.</p>
               <p>Now I will come to the examining of your witneſſes / whereof ſome of them are ſo bored in the eares / and branded in their foreheades / that no man neede to feare any credite they ſhall get before any iudge whereſoeuer / or before whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they come / but in the Romiſhe courte / and the papiſtes only excepted. For to let go Polidore Virgil / becauſe whatſoeuer hee ſayth / hee ſayth of the credite of another / lette vs come to Clement which is the author of this you ſpeake. And what is he? is there any ſo blinde that knoweth not that this was nothing leſſe then Clement / of whome S. Paule ſpeaketh / and which * ſome thinke was the <note place="margin">4. Phil. 3. <hi>Tert. de pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrip. aduerſus heret.</hi>
                  </note> firſt biſhop of Rome ordayned by Peter / and not rather a wicked helhounde / into whom the Lord had ſent ſathan to be a lying ſpirit in his mouth / to deceiue them for their vnthankfull receiuing of the goſpell? And he muſt witneſſe for the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop: a worthy witneſſe. For as all that popiſhe hierarchie came out of the bottomleſſe pitte of hell / ſo to vpholde the archbiſhop the necke of it / whereupon that Romiſhe monſter ſtandeth / are raiſed vp from hell baſtardes / Clemens and Anacletus / and in deede as it may appeare / the very naturall ſonnes of Sathan / and the ſworne ſouldiers of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>A man would haue thought / that the biſhop of Saliſburie maſter Iuell / had ſo pulled of the painting of the face of this Clement / that all good men would haue had him in deteſtation / ſo farre of would they haue bene to haue alledged out of him to proue any thing that is in controuerſie.</p>
               <p>The biſhop alledgeth both Euſebius and S. Ierome to proue / that none <note place="margin">In the reply to M. Harding fol. 7.</note> of thoſe workes which goe in his name / are his. And although the proufes bee ſtrong which the biſhop vſeth / being the witnes of vnſuſpected witneſſes: yet becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law / although it allow two witneſſes / notwithſtanding doth like better of three / I will ſet downe heere alſo Ireneus which was a great while before them both / and followed hard after the times of the true and vncounterfaite Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / and therefore could beſt tell of him / and of hys writings / &amp; yet * he maketh <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> mention but of one Epiſtle / which vpon occaſion amongſt the Corinthians / he wrote to them. In deede in another place of that booke / he ſheweth that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable / that Clement alſo eyther wrote or turned the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes. Now if that Epiſtle to the Corinthes / were extante / we ſhoulde eaſely
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21261:47"/> ſet by comparing thoſe that are now in hys name with that / what a my ſhapen thing this is.</p>
               <p>And if ſo be that Ireneus coniecture be good / that Clement was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or interpreter of the Epiſtle to the Hebrues / then what horrible iniurie is done to the holy ghoſt / whyle the ſame is ſuppoſed the wryter of thys booke to the Hebrewes / which is the author of ſuche beggery / as thys Clement brought into the worlde? And I pray you / doe you holde that it is the true chriſtyan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion / whyche that booke contayneth? Coulde none of theſe conſyderations driue you from the teſtimonie of thys Clement? it goeth very harde wyth the archbyſhop / when theſe Clementes and Anacletuſſes / muſt be brought to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derproppe hym.</p>

               <p>For anſwere vnto hym / although he be not worth the anſwering / I ſay that firſt it may be well ſayde heere of the office of the Archbyſhop / that the father of it was an Amorite / and mother a Hittite / that is / that it commeth of very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous parentage / the beginning therof being of the idolatrous nations.</p>
               <p>And whereas Clement maketh S. Peter the Apoſtle to make it as it were hys adopted ſonne / thereby to wipe away the ſhame of hys birth / it doth S. Peter ſhamefull iniury. For beſides that it was farre from S. Peter / to take thys authoritie to hym ſelfe / not only of making archbyſhops through out euery prouince / but alſo inſtituting a new order or office / without the councell of the reſt of the apoſtles / which none elſe of the apoſtles dyd / and which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the practiſe of S. Peter / both in the firſt and ſixt of the Actes / contrary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the practiſes of the apoſtles / which after ſhall appeare: I ſay beſides thys / is it lyke that S Peter would graſſe the nobleſt plant (as it is ſayde) of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the goſpell / in ſuch a rotten ſtocke of that which was moſt abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all idolarrie? for the greater they were in the ſeruice of the idolles / the more deteſtable were they before God.</p>
               <p>The Lorde / when he woulde geuelawes of worſhipping / vnto hys people / <note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 27. Deu. 22. 11. 12 Leuit. 11.</note> in the things that were indifferent / of ſhauing &amp; cutting / and apparell wearing / ſayth to his people / that they ſhoulde not doe ſo / and ſo / becauſe the Gentiles dyd ſo / yea euen in thoſe things / the vſe whereof was otherwiſe very profitable / and incommodious to forbeare / he would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithſtanding to abſtaine from / as from ſwines fleſh / conneys. &amp;c. to the end that hee might haue them ſeuered / <note place="margin">Deut. 14. Ephe. 2. 14.</note> as appeareth in S. Paule / by a great and high wall from other nations.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is very vnlike that S. Peter would frame the miniſterie of the goſpell (which is no ceremonie / but of the ſubſtance of the goſpell) by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the heatheniſh / and idolatrous functions.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:21261:48"/>
               <p> If one had ſayde / that the Lord had ſhapen hys common wealth / by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of other common wealthes / although it had bene moſt vntrue (all other flouriſhing common wealthes of Athens / Lacedemon / &amp; Rome / borowing their good lawes of the Lordes common wealth) yet had it bene more tollerable: but to ſay he framed the miniſtery of the goſpell / by the prieſthode of idolatrie / is to fetch chaſtitie out of Sodome / and to ſeeke for heauen in hell.</p>
               <p>And if ſo be that the Lord had delighted in thys hierarchie / he would rather haue taken of hys owne / then borowed of others / of hys owne church / then of the ſinagogue of Sathan. For vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law beſides the Leuites / there were prieſtes / and aboue them a high prieſt.</p>
               <p>And to ſay that Peter appoynted archbyſhoppes and byſhoppes / by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the idolaters / is after a ſort to make the law to come out of Egypt or Babylon / and not out of Sion or Ieruſalem / as the Prophet ſayth. You ſay <note place="margin">Eſay. 2. 3.</note> after that / Iames was an archbyſhop: if he were / he was the firſt / and placed ouer the Iewes.</p>
               <p>And although S. Peter might to gaine the Gentiles / he content to vſe their idolatrous functions / with a little chaunge of their names / yet there is none ſo mad / to thinke that he would tranſlate any ſuch function from the Gentiles vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iewes / whych were neuer before accuſtomed with any ſuch Flamines / or Archiflamines. And thys I dare generally and at once ſay againſt you and your Clement / that the Lord tranſlated diuers things out of the Law / into the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell <note place="margin">5. Math. 22. 9. Iohn. 22.</note> / as the Preſbytery or elderſhyp / excommunication / and the office of Deacons (as it is thought) for that the Saduces / of whome ſo often mention is made in the goſpell / are thought to haue had that offyce to prouide for the poore / for thoſe that know the Hebrew tongue / doe vnderſtand that <hi>tſaddikim and tſedacah,</hi> do not only ſignifie iuſtice and iuſt men / but alſo almes and almes men: I ſay theſe and others more tranſlated from the law vnto the goſpell / but neyther you nor your Clement / ſhall euer be able to ſhew / that the Lord euer tranſlated any thing from Genteliſme into the goſpell.</p>
               <p>We reade in the Actes / that all the Gentiles were commaunded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <note place="margin">Act. 15. 29.</note> them ſelues vnto the Iewes in the abſtayning from bloude and ſtrangled meate for a tyme / but we can neuer finde that the Iewes were commaunded to conforme them to the Gentiles in their ceremonies / the reaſon wherof is / becauſe the one was ſometymes the law of God / and therefore he that had conſcience in it / was to be borne with / and the other came from men / and out of their forge / which the Lord would neuer geue ſo much honor vnto / as to make other men by any meanes ſubiect vnto them.</p>
               <p>But what if there were no ſuch offices amongſt the Gentiles &amp; Paganes / as Archiflamines / or Protoflamines? whereof before I ſhew the coniectures which I haue / I muſt geue the (gentle reader) to vnderſtand / that I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that there are diuers which ſay there were ſuch offices amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles / and namely heere in Englande / that there were. 25.

And Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barde in hys fourthe booke ſpeaketh of it / as of a generall thing that was in all places where Paganiſme was. But if ſo be that the relygion of other Paganes dyd follow / and was lyke vnto that of the Romaines (which is very probable) they being then the rulers of the whole worlde in a maner / vnto whoſe example all men doe lightly conforme them ſelues / euen without commaundement / then there is great likelyhoode / there were no ſuch archiflamines / or protoflamines out of Tullie / which ſheweth that there was amongſt the Romaines dyuers kindes of prieſtes / whereof ſome were called flamines / of a ſeuerall attire which

               <p>And if there were / I haue ſhewed how wycked it is to ſay that Peter fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the myniſterie of the goſpell by it.

               <p>Eraſmus followeth / which ſayth Titus was archbyſhop of Crete / whom I coulde anſwere with hys owne wordes / for I am ſure he will graunt me / that Titus &amp; Timothe had one office / the one in Epheſus / the other in Crete: but it appeareth by Eraſmus hys owne wordes / that Timothe was but byſhop of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus / therefore Titus was but byſhop of Crete.

               <p>And I pray you tell me / whether Eraſmus or the Greeke Scholiaſt / be more to bee beeleeued in thys poynte / out of whome is taken that whyche is in the latter ende of the Epyſtles to Tymothe and Tytus / where they bothe are called the firſt elected Byſhoppes that euer were / eyther of Epheſus or Creta.

And if heere you will cauill and ſay that the Scholiaſte whych ſayeth hee was Byſhoppe / denyeth not but that he alſo was an Archbyſhoppe / becauſe an archbyſhop is a byſhop / it may be anſwered caſely / that the Scholiaſte dyd not ſpeake nor wryte ſo vnproperly / as to call them by the generall name of byſhop / whome he myght as eaſely haue called (if the truth woulde haue let hym) by a more proper and particular name of archbyſhop.

               <p>There followeth Anacletus / an other of theſe witneſſes / which muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the name of an archbyſhop is not antychriſtian / of whome / as of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that went before / and Anicetus which followeth after / the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe may be verifyed / Aſke my fellow if I be a theefe.

               <p>And heere you put me in remembraunce of an other argument agaynſt the archbyſhop / which I will frame after thys ſorte. If there ſhoulde be any arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop many place / the ſame ſhoulde be eyther in reſpect of the perſone or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and hys excellencie / or in reſpecte of the magnificence of the place: but the moſt excellent myniſters that euer were / in the moſt famous places / were no archbyſhops / but byſhops only / therefore there is no cauſe why there ſhoulde be any archbyſhop. For if there were euer myniſter of a congregation worthy / that was Iames / if there were euer any citte that ought to haue thys honor / as that the myniſter of it ſhould haue a more honorable title / then the myniſters of other cities and townes / that was Ieruſalem / where the ſonne of God preached / and from whence the goſpell iſſued out vnto all places. And afterwarde that Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem decayed / and the church there / Antioche was a place where the notableſt men were that euer haue bene ſince / which alſo deſerued great honoure / for that there the * diſciples were firſt called chriſtians / but neyther was that called the <note place="margin">Act. 11. 26.</note> firſt and cheefeſt church / neyther the myniſters of it called the Arche or principal byſhoppes. And Euſebius to declare that thys order was firme and durable / <note place="margin">Euſ. 3. 23.</note> ſheweth that S. Iohn the Apoſtle / which ouer lyued the reſidue of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles / ordayned byſhops in euery church.</p>
               <p>Theſe two / Anacletus and Anicetus / you ſay / are ſuſpected / why do you ſay ſuſpected / when as they haue bene conuinced and condemned / and ſtande vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the pillery / with the cauſe of forgerie written in great letters / that he which runneth may reade? Some of the papiſtes them ſelues / haue ſuſpected them / but thoſe which mayntayne the truth haue condemned them as full of popery / full of blaſphemy / and as thoſe in whome was the very ſpirit of contradiction to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and their doctryne.</p>
               <p>And do you marke what you ſay / when you ſay that theſe are but ſuſpected?
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21261:49"/> Thus much you ſay / that it is ſuſpected / or in doubt / whether the whole body of poperie and antichriſtianitie were in the Apoſtles time / or ſone after or no / for Clement was in the Apoſtles time / and their ſcholer / and ſo you leaue it in dout, whether the apoſtles appoynted and were the authors of popery or no. I thinke if euer you had red the Epiſtles / you woulde neuer haue cited their authorities / nor haue ſpoken ſo fauourably of them as you doe.</p>
               <p>You come after to the councel of Nice / wherin I wil not ſticke with you / that you ſay it was holden the .CCC. xxx. yeare of the Lorde / when as it maye appeare by Euſebius hys Computation / that it was holden. Anno Domini CCC xx. and heere you take ſo greate a leape / that it is enoughe to breake the archbiſhoppes necke / to ſkippe at once .CCC. yeares / (that is / from the tyme of the apoſtles / vntill the time of the councell of Nice) wythout any teſtimony of any / either father / or ſtorie of faithe and credite / whych maketh once mention of an archbiſhop. What no mention of hym in Theophilus / byſhop of Antioche? none in Ignatius? none in Clemens Alexandrinus / none in Iuſtin Martyr / in Ireneus / in Tertullian / in Origine / in Cyprian / none in all thoſe olde Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers / out of the whych Euſebius gathereth hys ſtory? Was it for his baſenes and ſmalnes / that he could not be ſeene amongſt the byſhops / elders / and deacons / being the cheefe and principall of them all? can the Ceder of Lebanon be hid amongſt the boxe trees? Ariſtotle in his Rhethorike <hi>ad Theodecten,</hi> ſayeth / that it is a token of contempt / to forget the name of an other / belike therefore if there were any archbiſhop / he had no chaire in the church / but was as it ſemeth / digging at the metalles. For otherwiſe they that haue filled their bookes wyth the often mentioning of biſhops / would haue no doubt remembred him. But let vs heare what the councell of Nice hath for theſe titles.</p>
               <p>In the. 6. canon mention is made of a metropolitane biſhop: what is that to the metropolitane whych is now / either to the name / or to the office? of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it ſhal appeare afterwards. In the name I thinke there is a great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / betwene a metropolitane biſhop / &amp; metropolitane of England / or of al England. A Metropolitane biſhop was nothing els / but a biſhop of that place / which it pleaſed the Emperor or magiſtrate to make the chefe citie of the dioceſe or ſhire / and as for thys name / it maketh no more difference betwene biſhop and biſhop / then when I ſay a miniſter of London / and a miniſter of Nuington. There is no man that is well aduiſed / whych will gather of thys ſaying / that there is as great difference in preheminence betweene thoſe two miniſters / as is betweene London / and Nuington: for his office and preheminence / we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>

For the. 25. 26. 27. there are no ſuch canons of that councell: and although there be a thirtenthe canon / there is no worde of patriarke / or archdeacon / there contained. And I maruell wyth what ſhame you can thruſte vppon vs theſe counterfaite canons whych come out of the popes minte / yea / and whych are not to be found.

               <p>Ambroſe complaining of the miniſters or biſhops in thoſe dayes / ſayeth / it a man aſke them / who preferred them to be prieſtes / anſwere is made by and by / that the archbyſhop for an hundreth ſhillings / ordained me biſhop / to whome I gaue a hundreth ſhillings / that I might get the fauor to be biſhop / whych if I had not giuen / I had not bene byſhop. And afterward he ſayeth / that this gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him / that the archbyſhop ordained byſhops carnally / or for ſome carnall reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte. And thys is all the allowance that Ambroſe ſheweth of an archbyſhoppe. Your archbiſhop taketh all things in good parte / ſo that his very diſpraiſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth to hys commendation. And there is great likelyhode / that the archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop whych Ambroſe maketh mention of / was no other / then he whych for the time ruled the action / wherin byſhops were ordained / and after the action ended / had no more authoritye then the reſt.</p>
               <p>And I am moued ſo to thincke. Firſt / becauſe it is not like / that one only ordained byſhops / being contrary to the olde Canons of the beſt councelles / but that there were other / and that thys whome Ambroſe calleth archbyſhop / dyd gather the voyces. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly / becauſe it was very vnlike / that there was any abſolutely / a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue S. Ambroſe / in thoſe partes where he complaineth of euill byſhops / or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters made.</p>

               <p>For to proue the lawfulneſſe of the name of an archdeacon / the antiquitye / the neceſſitye of it / the teſtimonies of foure are broughte / which neither ſpeake of their lawfulnes / nor of their neceſſity / and they ſay not in deede ſo muche as God ſaue them: and two of theſe witneſſes are Popes / whereof the firſt / and beſt / or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that if the Metropolitane did not fetche hys pall at the apoſtolike ſea of Rome / wythin three monthes after he were conſecrated / that then he ſhould loſe his dignity / as Gratian witneſſeth in the decrees y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he aſcribeth vnto Damaſus.</p>
               <p>I doubt not therfore that this is but a forger / vpon whom you would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the archdeacon / for that Damaſus / in whoſe place you put this forger / liued An. 387. at what time the ſea of Rome had no ſuche tirannye as thys / and other things which are fathered of him / do prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

Now let it be ſeene what Auguſtines deane / maketh for the deane whych is nowe / and what faith and truſt M. Doctor vſeth / in reciting of the olde fathers.</p>
               <p>And vnto the ende that theſe teſtimonies might be more autenticall / &amp; haue ſome waight in them / M.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21261:51"/> nine monethes / but almoſte nine hundreth yeares / to be framed and faſhioned / or euer he could wyth all his partes be brought to light.

               <p>And Socrates ſayeth of the church of Rome and Alexandria (which were the moſt famous churches in the apoſtles times) that about the yeare. 430. the Romaine and Alexandrian byſhops / leauing the ſacred function / were degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to a ſeculare rule or dominion.

And that it is very dangerous to drawe from thoſe riuers / the fountaines wherof are troubled and corrupted / eſpecially when as the wayes whereby they runne / are muddier and more fennie / then is the head it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And although M.

And a little after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward / that they are vnlearned / and ignorant / whych ſay otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Heere is a victory blowne wyth a great and ſounding trumpet / that might haue bene piped wyth an oten ſtraw. And if it ſhuld be replied againe / that M. Doctor hathe declared in thys / little learning / little reading / and les iudgement / there might grow controuerſies wythout all frute. And by and by / in ſaying that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> archbyſhops beginning is vnknown / in ſtead of a baſtard / which ſome brought into the church / that hid them ſelues becauſe they were aſhamed of the childe / he will make vs beleeue that we haue a new Melchiſedech / without father / wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mother / and whoſe generation is not knowne / and ſo concludeth wyth the place of S. Auguſtine / as farre as he remembreth in the. 118. epiſtle to Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: that the originall of them is from the apoſtles them ſelues.</p>
               <p>Heere M. Doctor ſeemeth to ſeeke after ſome glory of a good memory / as thoughe he had not Auguſtine by him / when he wrote this ſentence. And yet he maruellouſly forgetteth him ſelfe / for he vſed this place before in hys. 23. page / and citeth it there preciſely and abſolutely / where alſo I haue ſhewed howe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly that ſentence of Auguſtine is approued / &amp; howe that therby a window
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21261:52"/> is open to bring in all popery / and whatſoeuer other corrupt opinions. That the names of Lordes / and honor / as they are vſed in this realme / are not meete to be giuen to the miniſters of the goſpell / there hath bene ſpoken before.</p>
               <p>As for Prelate of the Garter / if it be a nedefull office / there are inow to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute it beſides the miniſters / whych / for as much as they be apoynted to watch ouer the ſoules of men purchaſed wyth the bloud of Chriſt / all men vnderſtande / that it is not meete that they ſhould attend vpon the body / much les vpon the leg / and leaſt of all vpon the Garter. It is not vnlawfull for Princes to haue mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their honor / but alſo it is not lawful to take thoſe that God hath appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for an other ende / to vſe to ſuche purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt heere (good Reader) that M. Doctor keepeth hys olde wonte of manifeſt peruerting of the wordes and meaning of the authors of the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / for where as they ſay / that the name of Earle / Countie Palatine / Iuſtice of peace / and Quorum / Commiſſioner / are antichriſtian / when they are geuen to miniſters of the church / whoſe calling wil not agree wyth ſuch titles / he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſimply / that they ſay that they be altogither vnlawfull / and ſimply antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. As / if I ſhould reaſon that it is not meete that the Quenes maieſty ſhuld preach or miniſter the Sacraments / therefore it is not meete that there ſhould be any preaching or miniſtering of the ſacraments.</p>
               <p>Now letting pas all your hard words / &amp; vnbrotherly ſpeaches / wyth your vncharitable Prognoſtications / and colde propheſies / I will come to examine / whether you haue any better hap in prouing the office / then you had in prouing the name.</p>
               <p>And wheras in the former treatiſe of the name of the archbyſhop / he blew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trompet before the victory / here in this of the office he bloweth it / before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the fielde / or ſtriketh one ſtroke / ſaying / that they little conſider what they wryte / that they are contemners of auncient wryters / &amp; that they neuer red them / and that they are vnlearned / which deny theſe things which he affirmeth. Wel / what we read / &amp; how vnlearned we are / is not the matter which we ſtriue for. The iudgement thereof is firſt wyth God / and then with the churches / and in their iudgements we are content to reſt. But if you be ſo greatly learned / and we ſo vnlearned / and ſmally red / then the truth of our cauſe ſhall more appeare / that is maintained wyth ſo ſmall learning &amp; reading / againſt men of ſuche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge and great reading. And yet I knowe not why (if we be not to idle) we ſhuld not be able to read as much as you / which may haue leiſure to read a good long wryter / or euer you can ryde / only to ſee / and ſalute your houſes and liuings / being ſo many / and ſo farre diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t one from an other. And if we be ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned / and holde ſuche dangerous opinions of Papiſtrie and Anabaptiſtry / as you beare men in hand we do / why do you not by the example of the miniſters in Germanie / procure a publike diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / where you may both win your ſpurres / and ſuch deteſtable opinions / wyth the ignorance of the authors / may be diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the whole world? But let vs heare what is ſayd.</p>
               <p>Cyprian (ſayth he) ſpeaking of the office of an archbyſhop. &amp;c. Onles (good reader) thou wilt firſt beleue that Cyprian ſpeaketh of an archbyſhop / and haſte before conceiued a ſtrong imagination of it / M. Doctor can proue nothing. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle ſayeth that vncunning Painters / wryte the names of the beaſtes whych they painte in their tables / for becauſe otherwiſe it coulde not be knowne what they painte: ſo M. Doctor miſtruſting that the archbyſhop will not be knowne by his deſcription / wryteth firſt the name of that he wil paint out.</p>
               <p>Thys is it whych we ſtriue about / wherof the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy is / and this M. doctor taketh for graunted. He accuſeth the authors of the admonition / for faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the petition of the principle / or deſiring to haue that graunted whych is denyed / &amp; yet I am ſure / that in the whole admonition / there is not ſuch a groſſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21261:52"/> petition as thys is. Where / or in what wordes dothe S. Cyprian ſpeake of the office of an archbyſhop? And heere by the way it is to be obſerued of the reader / how neare a kin the Pope and the archbiſhop be. For this office is confirmed by the ſame places / that the popes is / the places and arguments which are brought againſte hym / are ſoluted wyth the ſame ſolutions that they vſe / whych main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the papacie. For theſe places of Cyprian be alledged for the popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macye / and in deede they make as muche for the Pope / as for the archbyſhoppe. For / although they be two heades / yet they ſtande vpon one necke / and therfore the reformed churches whych cutte right / did ſtrike them bothe of at one blowe. In neyther of the ſentences heere alledged out of Cyprian / nor in all his works / as hath bene before noted / is there one worde of an archbyſhop / and yet M. doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſayeth that he ſpeaketh of an archbyſhop.</p>
               <p>Before he ſhewed the name wythout the office / and now he goeth about to ſhew the office wythout the name / ſo that he can neuer make bothe the name and office meete together. To ſhape out an archbyſhop heere / you muſt needes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preate the wordes (byſhop and prieſt) archbyſhop and hygh prieſt / for Cyprian maketh mention of no other name of miniſterie in thoſe places. And if you maye haue thys ſcope of interpreating / it wil not be harde for you / to proue that ſtones be bread / and that chaulke is cheeſe. Let vs ſee what is a byſhop or prieſt (I vſe the name of prieſt againſt my wil / but becauſe it is <hi>ſacerdos,</hi> &amp; you ſo tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlate it / that it may be better vnderſtanded what I anſwere to you / I am content to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe you ſo farre) I ſay let vs conſider what is a byſhop or prieſt by S. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an / and thereby we ſhall knowe / what an archbyſhop he ſetteth forthe vnto vs. Whych thing may appeare manifeſtly / by that which he ſayeth in the ſame Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle / that the byſhop that is appoynted into the place of hym that is dead / is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen peaceably by the voyce of all the people.</p>
               <p>I thincke you will not ſay that all the people through oute the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince / or through out a whole dioceſe (as we count a dioceſe) mette togither / for that had bene bothe a great diſorder and confuſion / a great charge to the church / and in the time of perſecution as that was / to haue offered the whole church in all the prouince / into the mouthe of the wolfe.</p>
               <p>And leaſt peraduenture you ſhoulde haue thys hole to hide your ſelfe in / ſaying that it might be procured / that in euery church or pariſhe through out ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prouince or dioceſe / the conſent of the people might be aſked / and they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their places where they dwel / Cyprian in the next epiſtle / doth put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of all queſtion / ſaying that the prieſt (whome he after calleth byſhop) is choſen in the preſence of the people / &amp; in the eyes of all / ſo that Cyprians byſhop / whome you will needes haue an archbyſhop / had neither prouince nor dioceſe / as we call a dioceſe / but only a church or congregation / ſuche as the miniſters and paſtors wyth vs / whych are appoynted vnto ſeuerall townes. Which may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare / in that Cyprian ſayeth / that out of one prouince there were. 90. bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops / whych condemned Priuatus. Nowe / if there were. 90. byſhops in one prouince whych met / and yet not all that were in that prouince (as may appeare out of the ſame Epiſtle) all men do vnderſtand that the ſcope that Cyprians by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or archbyſhop (as you will haue him) had / was no ſuche thing as a dioceſe or a prouince. I coulde bring infinite teſtimonies out of Cyprian / to proue that the byſhop in his time / was nothing elſe but S. Paules byſhop / that is / one that had cure and charge of one flocke / whych was ſo placed as it might be taught of hym / and ouerſeene by him / and gouerned by hym / and of whom in matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God / it myght depend.</p>
               <p>Furthermore / to ſhape the archbyſhop by theſe places of Cyp. you muſt be driuen to expound this word (church) prouince. The papiſtes (which cite thys place for the pope / as you doe for the archbiſhop) expounde the worde (churche)
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21261:53"/> heere / to be the whole church vniuerſal and catholike / and in dede / although it be falſly expounded ſo in thys place / yet may they doe it wyth more probability and likelyhode / then to expound it a prouince / forſomuch as theſe words (the church) is oftner red / both in the ſcripture / and old wryters / to ſignify the whole church / then any prouince of one realme. But lette Cyprian expounde him ſelfe what he meaneth by a church heere / although that may eaſely appeare by that / whych is ſpoken of S. Cyprian hys biſhop. Wheras Cyprian declareth / that Cornelius the biſhop of the church which was in Rome / would not let <hi>Feliciſſimum</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation hereticke / being caſte oute by the byſhoppes of Affricke / to enter into the church / he declareth ſufficiently / that he meaneth that companye of the faithfull / whych were gathered togither at Rome / to heare the word / and to communicate at the ſacramentes. For it was not Cornelius part to ſhutte him out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince / neither indeede could he / him ſelfe being not able without hazard (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the perſecution that then was) to tary in any part of the prouince. Againe / ſpeaking againſt the Nouatian hereticke / he ſheweth that throughe hys wicked opinion of denying of repentance to thoſe that were fallen / the confeſſion of faults in the churche was hindred. Nowe it is manifeſt that confeſſion was not made through out the prouince / but in that particulare church where the partye dwelt that committed the fault. Therefore Cyprian vnderſtandeth by the name of the church / neither dioceſe (as we call dioceſe) and muche les a whole prouince. And in the ſame Epiſtle / ſpeaking of thoſe whych had fallen / he ſayeth / that they durſt not come ſo much / as to the threſholde / or entry of the churche / where he alſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the church to the prouince / ſaying that they roue about the prouince / and run about to deceiue the brethren. Seeing therefore / the byſhop whych Cyprian ſpeaketh of / is nothing elſe but ſuch as we call paſtor / or as the common name w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs is parſon / and his church wherof he is biſhop / is neither dioceſe nor prouince / but a congregation whych mete togither in one place / &amp; to be taught of one man / what ſhould M. doctor meane to put on this great name of archbyſhop / vpon ſo ſmall a byſhoppricke? as it were Saules great harnes / vpon Dauid hys little body / or as if a man ſhould ſet a wide huge porche / before a little houſe.</p>
               <p>And leaſt that M. doctor ſhould ſay / that notwithſtanding the biſhops had but ſeuerall churches / yet one of them might haue either a title more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then the reſt / or authority and gouernment ouer the reſt / that ſhall be likewiſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of Cyprian. And firſt for the title and honor of archbiſhop / it appeareth how Cyprian held that as a proud name / for that he obiecteth to Florentius as a <note place="margin">4. <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>epiſt.</hi>
                  </note> preſumptuous thing / for that in beleuing certaine euill reports of hym / and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudging of him / he did appoynt him ſelfe biſhop of a biſhop / and iudge ouer hym / which was for the time / appoynted of God to be iudge. And heerein alſo / I may vſe the ſame reaſons which the godly writers of our times vſe againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope / to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had no ſuperiority in thoſe dayes ouer other biſhops / for that the other biſhops called him brother / and he them / called him fellow biſhop / &amp; he them. For ſo doth Cyprian cal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhops of that prouince in his epiſtle / his fellow biſhops / and in diuers places his brethren. And in the ſentence which he ſpake in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Carthage / he ſayth / none of vs doth take him ſelfe to be biſhop of biſhops.</p>
               <p>Nowe / that there was no authoritye of one byſhop ouer an other / and that there was none ſuche / as when controuerſies roaſe / tooke vppon hym the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of them / or any one to whome it appertained / to ſee the vnitye of the church kept / and to ſee that all other biſhops / and the cleargy / did their duety (as M. Doctor beareth vs in hand) it may clearely be ſeene in diuers places of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian / and firſt of all in that ſentence / which he ſpake in the councel of Carthage, where he proceedeth further after this ſort / that none of them did by any tiranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call feare / binde his felowes in office / or any fellow byſhops / to any neceſſity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience / ſeeing that euery biſhop hath for his free libertye and power / hys owne
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21261:53"/> iudgement or diſcretion / as one which can not be iudged of an other / as he alſo hym ſelfe / can not iudge an other. But (ſayth he) we ought to tary and waite for the iudgement of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt / which only / and alone / hath power to ſet vs ouer hys church / &amp; to iudge of our doing. And in the ſame Epiſtle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the firſt place is taken by M. Doctor / he ſayth that vnto euery one a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the flocke is appoynted / which euery one muſt rule and gouerne / as he that ſhall render an accompt of hys deede vnto the Lord. And in an other place hee <note place="margin">2. <hi>Lib. ep.</hi> 1.</note> ſayth / we doe not vſe any compulſion or vyolence ouer any / nor appoynt no law to any / ſeeing that euery one that is ſet ouer the church / hath in the gouernment / the free diſpoſition of hys owne will / whereof he ſhall geue an accompt vnto the Lord. And yet Cyprian was the byſhop of the metropolitane or cheefe ſeate / and one whome for hys learning and godlyneſſe / the reſt no doubt had in great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence / and gaue great honor vnto.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is ſayde for the preſeruation of vnitie / one muſt be ouer all / S. Cyprian ſheweth / that the vnitie of the church is conſerued / not by hauing <note place="margin">4. <hi>Lib. ep.</hi> 9.</note> one byſhop ouer all. But by the agreement of the byſhops / one with an other. For ſo he wryteth that the church is knit and coupled together (as it were with the glew) of the byſhops conſenting one with an other / and as for the compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of controuerſies / it is manyfeſt / that it was not done by one byſhop in a prouince / but thoſe byſhoppes whych were neere the place where the ſchiſme or hereſie ſprang.</p>
               <p>For / ſpeaking of the appeaſing of controuerſies / and ſchiſmes / and ſhewing <note place="margin">

                  </note> how dyuers byſhops were drawne into the hereſie of Nouatus / he ſayth / that the vertue and ſtrength of the Chriſtians was not ſo decayed or languiſhed / but that there was a portion of prieſtes / which dyd not geue place vnto thoſe ruines / and ſhipwrackes of fayth.</p>
               <p>And in an other place he ſayth: therefore moſt deare brother / the plentifull <note place="margin">3. <hi>Lib. ep.</hi> 13.</note> body or company of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſts / are as it were with the glew of mutuall concorde &amp; bande of vnitie ioyned together / that if any of our company be author of an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie / and goe about to deſtroy and rent the flocke of Chriſt / the reſt ſhould helpe / and as profitable &amp; mercifull ſhepheards / gather together the ſheepe of the Lord: wherby it is manifeſt / that the appeaſing &amp; compoſing of controuerſies / &amp; hereſies was not then thought to be moſt fitte to be in one byſhops hand / but in as many as coulde conueniently aſſemble together / according to the danger of the hereſie which ſprang / or deepe roote which it had taken / or was like to take. And that there was in his time no ſuch authoritie geuen / as that any one might remoue the cauſes or controuerſies which roſe / as now we ſee there is / when the byſhop of the dioceſe / taketh the matters in controuerſie / which riſe in any church within hys dioceſe / from the miniſter and elders / to whome the deciſion pertayneth / and as when the archbyſhop taketh it away from the byſhop / it may appeare in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame thirde Epiſtle of the firſt booke / where he ſayth after this ſort. It is ordayned / &amp; it is equall and right / that euery mans cauſe ſhoulde be there hearde / where the fault was committed. And a little after he ſayth: It is meete to handle the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there / where they may haue both accuſers / and witneſſes of the fault / whiche although it be ſpoken of them / which fied out of Affrike vnto Rome / yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is generall / and doth as wel ſerue agaynſt theſe Eccleſiaſticall perſons / which will take vnto them the decyding of thoſe controuerſies that were done a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth mile of them.</p>
               <p>And whereas M. Doctor in both places of Cyprian / ſemeth to ſtand much vpon the wordes (One Byſhop and prieſt) the reaſon thereof doth appeare in an other place of Cyprian / moſt manifeſtly / and that it maketh no more to proue that <note place="margin">

                  </note> there ought to be one archbyſhop ouer a hole prouince / then to ſay / that there ought to be but one huſbande proueth / that therefore there ſhould be but one huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21261:54"/> in euery countrey or prouince / which ſhoulde ſee that all the reſt of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes / doe their dueties to their wyues. For thys was the caſe. A Nouatian hereticke being condemned / and caſt out of the churches of Affrica / by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the byſhops / &amp; not able by embaſſage ſent to them to obtayne to be receiued to their communion and fellowſhip agayne / goeth afterwardes to Rome / and being lykewiſe there repelled / in tyme getteth hym ſelfe by certayne which fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hys hereſie / to be choſen byſhop there at Rome (Cornelius being the byſhop or paſtor of thoſe which were there godly mynded) whereupon it commeth / that Cyprian vrgeth (one byſhop / one prieſt in the church) becauſe at Rome there was two / whereof one was a wolfe / which ought not to haue bene there / conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering there was but one church / which was gathered vnder the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Cornelius. And therefore by that place of Cyprian it can not be gathered / that there ought to be but one byſhop in one citie / if the multitude of profeſſors require more / and that all can not well gather them ſelues together in one congregation / to be taught of one man / much leſſe can it ſerue to proue / that there ſhould be but one in a whole dioceſe or prouince. I graunt that in later tymes / and which went more from the ſimplicitie of the primitiue church / they tooke occaſion of theſe wordes to decree / that there ſhould be but one byſhop in a citie / but that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be concluded of Cyprians wordes / if it be vnderſtanded why he vrgeth one byſhop and one prieſt. If therefore neyther word (byſhop nor prieſt) do make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to proue an archbyſhop / nor thys worde (church) doth imply any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince / nor in theſe wordes (one byſhop one prieſt) there is nothing leſſe ment / then that there ſhould be one archbyſhop ouer all the byſhops and cleargie in a prouince / and if Cyprian will neyther allow of the title of archbyſhop / nor of the authoritie and office / but in playne wordes ſpeaketh agaynſt both / we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude / that M.

                  </gap>ilnot only not beare any thing of hym / but which hath done all that coulde be / to make hym goe a foote / and hand in hand with hys fellowes. There are other reaſons which M. Doctor vſeth / as thys / a notable one. S. Cyprian ſpeaketh not of the vſurped power of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome / therefore he ſpeaketh of the office of an archbyſhop and metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane. It is hard to call thys argument to any head of fallation / for it hath not ſo much as a colour of a reaſon / &amp; I thincke it can deceiue no body but your ſelf. An other reaſon is / that all the godlyeſt &amp; beſt learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do expound the place of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian in the 3. Epiſt. of the firſt booke of an archbyſhop. The vanitie of thys ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing / that the godly &amp; learned wryters ſo expound it / I haue ſhewed before / and heere it commeth to be conſidered agayne. I will not ſay that no godly nor learned wryter / expoundeth the place of Cyprian of the authoritie of an archbiſhop.</p>
               <p>But firſt I deſire M. Doctor to ſet downe but one / and then I will leaue it to thy conſyderation (gentle reader) to thincke / whether M. Doctor hath red any learned or godly mans expoſition to be ſuche / when he hath not red thoſe which are neareſt hym / I meane our owne countrey men. I ſay he hath not red them / becauſe I woulde thinke charitably ſo of hym / rather then that he ſhoulde haue red them / and yet ſpeake vntruely of them / and father thoſe things of them / which they neuer ſpeake.</p>
               <p>M.

               <p>And although Ierome beſides his other faultes / might haue alſo in thys matter ſpoken more ſoundly / yet we ſhall eaſely perceiue / that he is a great deale further / from eyther the title or office of an archbyſhop / or elſe from the authority that a byſhop hath with vs / then he is from the ſimplicity of the miniſtery which ought to be / and is commended vnto vs by the worde of God.</p>
               <p>And heere I muſt put M. Doctor in remembrance / howe vnfitly he hath dedicated his boke vnto the churche / whych hath ſo patched it / and peeced it of a number of ſhreds of the doctors / that a ſentence of the ſcripture / eyther truely or falſely alledged / is as it were a Phenix in thys boke. If he would haue had the church beleue hym / he oughte to haue ſetled their iudgement / and grounded their faith vpon the ſcriptures / whych are the only foundations whervpon the church may build. Nowe he doth not only not geue them grounde to ſtand of / but he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them into wayes whych they can not folowe / nor come after him. For / ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be thoſe whych are learned / and beſides / haue the meanes and abilitye / to haue the bokes whych are heere cited (which are the leaſt and ſmalleſt portion of the church) how can they know that theſe things be true whych are alledged / and as I haue ſaid / if they could know / yet haue they nothing to ſtay them ſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / and quiet their conſcience / in allowing that which M. Doctor would ſo faine haue them like of. Therefore he might haue much more fitly dedicated his booke vnto the learned and riche / whych haue furniſhed libraries.</p>
               <p>Ierome ſayeth / that at the firſt / a byſhoppe and an Elder (whych you call prieſt) were all one / but afterward through factions / &amp; ſchiſmes / it was decreed / that one ſhould rule ouer the reſt. Now I ſay againſt this order (that the biſhop
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21261:55"/> ſhoulde beare rule ouer all) that which our ſauioure Chriſt ſayth vnto the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes / from the beginning it was not ſo / and therefore I require that the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may ſtande / which was / that a byſhop &amp; elder were all one. And if you place ſo great authoritie agaynſt the inſtitution of God in a mortall man: heare what Tertullian ſayth vnto you. <note place="margin">Contra prax.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That is true / whatſoeuer is firſt: and that is falſe / whatſoeuer is later.</p>
               <p>Ierome and you / confeſſe that thys was firſt / that the byſhop was all one with the elder / and firſt alſo by the word of God / then I conclude that that is true. You both doe likewiſe confeſſe that it came after that one bare rule ouer the reſt / then I conclude that that is falſe / for all that is falſe that is later. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Ierome in the ſame place of Titus ſayth after thys ſort. As the elders know them ſelues to be ſubiect by a cuſtome of the church vnto hym that is ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them: ſo the byſhops muſt know that they are greater then the elders / rather by cuſtome then by any truth of the inſtitution of the Lord / and ſo they ought to gouerne the church in common.</p>
               <p>Now / ſeing that Ierome confeſſeth that a byſhop and an elder / by God his inſtitution are all one / and that cuſtome of the church hath altered thys inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / for the taking away of thys cuſtome and reſtoring of the Lordes inſtitution / I ſay as our ſauiour Chriſt ſayd / why doe you breake the commaundementes of <note place="margin">Math. 15. 3.</note> God / to eſtabliſhe your owne traditions? for the one is the inſtitution of God / and the other the tradition of the church / and if a mans teſtimony be ſo much with M. Doctor / let hym heare what the ſame Tertullian fayth: whatſoeuer ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">De veland virg.</note> agaynſt the truth / ſhall be accompted hereſie / euen although it be an olde cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. Now I will turne M. Doctors owne argument vpon hys head / after thys ſorte. In the apoſtles tymes there were ſchiſmes and hereſies / but in their tymes there were no archbyſhops ordayned to appeaſe them / therefore the beſt meanes of compoſing of controuerſies / and keping concorde / is not by hauing an archbyſhop to be ouer a whole prouince. That there was none in the apoſtles tymes / thus it may appeare. If there were any / they were eyther ordayned by the apoſtles and their authoritie / or elſe without / and beſides their authoritie. If there were any without / and beſides their authoritie / then they are therefore to be condemned the more / becauſe in their tymes they ſtarte vp without their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And if the apoſtles dyd ordayne them / there was ſome vſe of them to that wherunto they were ordayned / but there was no vſe of them / to that wherunto they were ordayned / therefore the apoſtles dyd not ordayne them. The vſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto M. Doctor ſayth they were ordayned / was to compoſe controuerſies / and end ſchiſmes / but to thys they were not vſed / whereupon it followeth / that if there were any / they were vnprofitable. That they were not vſed to any ſuch ende / it ſhall be perceiued by that which followeth.</p>
               <p>At Antioche there roſe a great and daungerous hereſie / that had in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Act. 15. 2.</note> infected all the churches / which ſhaked the very foundation of the ſaluation of Gods children / that was / whether fayth were ſufficient to iuſtifie without circumciſion. The matter was diſputed of both ſides / it could not be agreed of. What doe they now? Doe they ordayne ſome Archbiſhop / Archprophet / Archa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle / or any one cheefe to whome they will referre the controuerſie / or vppon whome they will depend? nothing leſſe. And if they would haue had the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies ended by one / what deuine was there euer / or ſhall there be more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that purpoſe then S. Paule / which was amongſt them? Why doe they ſende abrode for remedy / when they had it at home? why with great charges and long iourneys / which they might haue had without charges / or one foote ſet out of the dore? what doe they then? They ſende Paule and Barnabas to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem / as if the leſſer townes / ſhould ſend to the churches of the vniuerſities / and of London / to deſire their helpe in the determining of the controuerſie. And what
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21261:55"/> is Paule and Barnabas ambaſſage / is it to deſire the iudgement or minde of ſome one? it muſt needes be anſweared wyth S. Luke / that they came to know <note place="margin">Acts. 15. 23.</note> the reſolution of the churche / and yet there were the apoſtles / wherof euery one was better able both ſharply to ſee / and to iudge incorruptly wythout affection / then any archbyſhop that euer was. If therfore in ſo great aboundance &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the gifts of God / and in that time when as controuerſies might haue bene referred wythout daunger of error vnto one only / thys miniſterie of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all / was not thought good: now / when the gifts are les / and the danger of error more / to make an archbyſhop for the deciding of controuerſies / and auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſchiſmes / is a thing ſo ſtraunge / that I am not able to ſee the reaſon of it. For to whych ſo euer of the apoſtles the controuerſy had bene referred / it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that he would haue geuen a true ſentence of it.</p>
               <p>And if any can ſhew me one man in theſe times / of whom we may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red / that he will pronounce the truth of euery queſtion whych ſhall ariſe / he ſhall make me ſomewhat more fauorable to the archbyſhop / then preſently I am. For although there were found one ſuch as could not erre / yet I could not conſent that the matter ſhould lye only vpon his hand / ſeeing that the apoſtles whych could not erre in theſe matters / would not take that vpon them / and ſeeing that by that meanes the iudgement of the church ſhould be contemned / and further / for that the iudgement of one man in a controuerſy / is not ſo ſtrong to pull vp errors that are rooted in mennes minds / as the iudgement and conſent of many. For / that the iudgement of many is very apt either to confirme a truth / or to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute falſhode / it is euident that S. Paule doth hold forth / as it were a buckler <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 16. 1. Cor. 14. 33.</note> againſt the frowardnes of certaine / the authority of the church.</p>
               <p>Furthermore / if this diſtinction came vp in the apoſtles time / and by them / how commeth it to pas / that they neuer mention it / nay / how commeth it to pas that euen S. Paule in that very Epiſtle where theſe voyces are found (I hold of Paule / I of Apollo / I of Cephas whych are ſayd to be the cauſe of the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop / <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 29.</note>) ordaineth a cleane contrary to thys that M. Doctor commendeth? For when two or three prophets haue expounded the ſcriptures / he appoynteth that all the reſt that are there / ſhould iudge whether they haue done well or no.</p>
               <p>And how commeth it to pas that S. Paule being at Rome in priſon / and loking euery day when he ſhould geue vp hys laſt breath / commended vnto the church a perfect and an abſolute miniſtery / ſtanding of .v. parts / wherin he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 11.</note> mention / not one word of an archbyſhop: and ſayeth further / that that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery is able to entertain the perfect vnity / and knitting togither of the church? Do not all theſe things ſpeake / or rather cry / that there was not ſo much as a ſtep of an archbyſhop / in the apoſtles times? And if you will ſay / that the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did ordaine archbyſhops (as you haue in dede ſayd / &amp; do now againe) when as there is not one word in the wrytings of them / I pray you tell vs / how we ſhall hold out of the church / the vnwrytten verities of the papiſts? for my part / if it be true that you ſay / I can not tell what to anſwer vnto them. For our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / the apoſtles haue left a perfect rule of ordering the church wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten / and therfore we reiect their traditions / if / for no other cauſe / yet becauſe they are ſuperfluous / and more then neede. Now this degree of archbiſhop / being not only not mentioned in the ſcriptures / but alſo manifeſtly oppugned / it is too bold and hardy a ſpeache (that I ſay no more) to fetch the petegree of the archbyſhop / from the apoſtles times / and from the apoſtles them ſelues. But all thys time M. Doctor hath forgotten hys queſtion / whych was to proue an archbyſhop / wheras all theſe teſtimonies whych he alledgeth / make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion only of a biſhop / and therfore thys may rather confirme the ſtate of the byſhop in this realme / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the archbyſhop. But in the anſwere vnto them it ſhall appeare / that as there is not in theſe places ſo much as the name of an archbyſhop mentioned / ſo except
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21261:56"/> only the name of a biſhop / there ſhalbe found very little agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betwene the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in thoſe dayes / and thoſe whych are called byſhops in our time / &amp; with vs.</p>
               <p>And conſequently / although M. doctor thought wyth one whiting boxe / to haue whited two wals (by eſtabliſhing our archbyſhop and byſhop by the ſame teſtimonies of the fathers) yet it ſhalbe plaine / that in going about to defend both / he left both vndefended. Let vs therfore come firſt / to examine Ieroms reaſons / why one muſt be ouer the reſt / for in the teſtimony of men / that is only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded / whych is ſpoken eyther wyth ſome authority of the ſcripture / or wyth ſome reaſon grounded of the ſcripture: otherwiſe / if he ſpeake wythout eyther ſcripture or reaſon / he is as eaſely reiected as alledged. One (ſayth he) being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be ouer the reſt / bringeth remedy vnto ſchiſmes: how ſo? leaſt euery man (ſayeth he) drawing to him ſelfe / to breake the church in peeces.</p>
               <p>But I would aſke if the church be not in as great danger / when all is done at the pleaſure and luſt of one man / and when one caryeth all into error / as when one pulleth one peece wyth him / another an other peece / and the third hys partal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo wyth him. And it is harder to draw many into an error / then one / or that many ſhould be caryed away by their affections / then one / whych is euident in water / whych if it be but a little / it is quickly troubled and corrupted / but being much / it is not ſo eaſely. But by thys eccleſiaſticall Monarchie / all things are kept in peace: Nay / rather it hath bene the cauſe of diſcord / and well ſpring of moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſchiſme / as it is to be ſeene in the very decretals them ſelues. And admit it <note place="margin">

                  </note> were ſo / yet the peace whych is wythout truth / is more execrable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thouſand contentions. For / as by ſtriking of two flintes togither / there commeth out fire / ſo it may be / that ſometimes by contention / the truth whych is hidden in a darke peace / may come to light / whych by a peace in naughtines and wickednes / being as it were buryed vnder the ground / doth not appeare.</p>
               <p>If therfore ſuperiority &amp; domination of one aboue the reſt / haue ſuch force to keepe men from ſchiſmes / when they be in the truth / it hath as great force to kepe them togither in error / and ſo beſides that one is eaſier to be corrupted then many / thys power of one bringeth as great incommodity in keping them in error if they fall into it / as in the truth if they are in it. Moreouer / if it be neceſſary for the keping of vnity in the church of England / that one archbyſhop ſhould be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ouer all / why is it not as meete / that for the keping of the whole vniuerſall church / there ſhould be one archbyſhop / or byſhop ouer all / and the like neceſſity of the byſhop ouer all chriſtendome / as of the byſhop of all England / vnles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture it be more neceſſary / that there ſhould be one byſhop ouer the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall church / then ouer the church of England / for as much as it is more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that peace ſhould be kept / and ſchiſmes be auoyded in the vniuerſali church / then in the particulare church of England.</p>
               <p>If you ſay that the archbyſhop of England / hath hys authority graunted of the Prince / the Pope of Rome will ſay that Conſtantine or Phocas / whych was Emperor of all chriſtendome / did graunt him hys authority ouer all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But you will ſay that it is a lie / but the Pope will ſet as good a face / and make as great a ſhew therin / as you do in diuers poynts here. But admit it to be a lie (as in dede it is touching Conſtantine) yet I ſay further / that it may come to paſſe / &amp; it hath ben / that there may be one Chriſtian Ceſar ouer all the realmes whych haue churches. What if he then will geue that authority to one ouer all / that one king graunteth in hys land / may any man accept and take at hys hand ſuch authority? and if it be not lawful for him to take that authority / tel me what fault you can finde in him / whych may not be found in them?</p>
               <p>It will be ſayd that no one is able to do the office of a byſhop / vnto all the whole church / neither is there any one able to do the office of a byſhop to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole church of England. For when thoſe which haue ben moſt excellent in knowledge
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21261:56"/> and wiſedome / and moſt ready and quicke / in doing and diſpatching / matters / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes preſent / haue found enough to do to rule and gouerne one ſeuerall congregation: what is he whych (abſent) is able to diſcharge hys duety toward ſo many thouſand churches? And if you take exception / that although they be abſent / yet they may do by vnder miniſters / as by Archdeacons / Chauncellors / Officials / Commiſſaries / and ſuch other kinde of people / what doe you elſe ſay / then the Pope / whych ſayeth / that by hys Cardinalles / and archbyſhoppes / and Legates / and other ſuche like / he doeth all things? For wyth their hands he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all / and by their feete he is preſent euerye where / and wyth their eyes he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is done in all places. Let them take heede therfore / leaſt if they haue a common defence wyth the Pope / that they be not alſo ioyned nearer wyth hym in the cauſe / then peraduenture they be aware of. Truely it is againſt my will / that I am conſtrained to make ſuche compariſons / not that I thinke there is ſo great diuerſity betweene the Popedome and the archbyſhoppricke / but becauſe there being greate reſemblance betweene them / I meane / hauing regarde to the bare functions / wythout reſpecting the doctrine good or badde whych they vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde / that I ſay there being great reſemblance betweene them: there is yet as I am perſuaded / great difference betweene the parſons that execute them. The whych good opinion conceyued of them / I we moſte humbly beſeeche them by the glory of God / by the libertye of the churche purchaſed by the precious bloude of oure ſauioure Chriſte / and by their owne ſaluation / that they woulde not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue / by retaining ſo harde / ſuche exceſſiue and vniuſt dominion ouer the church of the liuing God.</p>
               <p>But Ierome ſayth / that this diſtinction of a byſhop / &amp; a miniſter or elder / was from ſ. Marke his time / vnto Dyoniſius time / wherby M. doctor would make vs beleeue / that Marke was the author of this diſtinction. But that can not be gathered by Ieromes words. For beſides that things being ordred then by the ſuffrages of the miniſters and elders / it might (as it falleth out of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times) be done without the approbation of ſ. Marke: the words (from Marke) may be rather taken excluſiuely / to ſhut oute S. Marke / and the time wherin he liued / then incluſiuely / to ſhut hym in the time wherin thys diſtinction roſe.</p>
               <p>How ſo euer it be / it is certaine that S. Marke did not diſtinguiſh &amp; make thoſe thyngs diuers / whych the holy ghoſte made all one. For then (whych the Lord forbid) he ſhoulde make the ſtory of the goſpell whych he wrote / ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>Againe / it is to be obſerued that Ierome ſayeth it was ſo in Alexandria: ſignifying therby / that in other churches it was not ſo. And in deede it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in diuers places of the auncient fathers / that they confounded prieſt &amp; by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop / &amp; toke them for all one / as Euſebius out of Ireneus calleth Anicete / Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us / Teleſphorus / Higinus / xyſtus / <hi>presbyterous cai proſtantas,</hi> elders / and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents. Cyprian confoundeth prieſt and byſhop in the epiſtles before recited / ſo <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. 26. <hi>De dignitate ſacerdotali.</hi> 1. Rom. 8.</note> doth Ambroſe in the place alledged before by M. doctor / and yet it is one thyng with vs / to be a prieſt (as M. doctor ſpeaketh) and an other thing to be a biſhop.</p>
               <p>Ieruſalem was a famous church / ſo was Rome as the apoſtle witneſſeth / ſo was Antioche and others / where alſo were great conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions / both in doctrine and otherwiſe / and yet for auoiding of contention and ſchiſme there / there was no one that was ruler of the reſt / therfore we ought rather to folowe theſe churches being many / in keping vs to the inſtitution of the apoſtles / then Alexandria being but one church / and departing from that inſtitution / and if there had bene any one ſet ouer all the reſt in other places / it would haue made much for the diſtinction that Ierome had recited. But againſt thys diſtinction of ſ. Ierome / I will vſe no other reaſon / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that whych Ierome vſeth in the ſame epiſtle to Euagrius. Ierome in that epiſtle / taketh vp very ſharply the archd. that he preferred hym ſelfe before the elder / &amp; the reaſon is / becauſe by the ſcripture y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deacon is inferior
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21261:57"/> vnto the elder. Now therfore Ierome him ſelfe confeſſing that by the ſcripture a byſhop &amp; an elder are equall / by Ieromes owne reaſon / the byſhop is to be ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehended / becauſe he lifteth hym ſelfe aboue the elder. But what helpeth it you / that there was a byſhop of Alexandria / whych vrge an archbyſhop / or what auauntageth it you / that there was one cheefe called a byſhop in euery ſeuerall congregation / whych would proue that there ought to be one byſhop / chefe ouer a thouſand congregations. What could haue bene brought more ſtrong to pull downe the archbyſhop out of hys throne / then that whych Ierome ſayeth there / when he affirmeth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> byſhop of the obſcureſt village or hamlet / hath as great authority and dignity as the byſhop of Rome? Eraſmus did ſee this / and ſayd / <hi>eironeuomenos,</hi> that is ieſtingly / that Ierome ſpake that of the byſhops of hys times / but if he had ſene how the metropolitanes of our age excell other biſhops / he wold haue ſpoken otherwiſe. And what could haue bene more fit to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed the large dominion and ſuperiority of our realme / then that that Ierome ſayth / when he appoynteth the byſhops ſea in an vplandiſhe towne / or in a pore village or hamlet / declaring therby that in euery towne there was a byſhop / and that the biſhop that he ſpeaketh of / differeth nothing at all from an elder / but that the byſhop had the ordaining of the miniſters / whervpon it doth appeare (which I promiſed to ſhew) that by this place of Ierome / there is neither name of arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop / nor ſo much as the ſhadow of his authority / and that the byſhops whych are now / haue beſides the name / no ſimilitude almoſt with the byſhops that were in Ieromes time / as for his reaſon / <hi>ad Luciferanos,</hi> it is the ſame whych he hath / <hi>ad Euag.</hi> and to Titus / and is already anſweared.</p>
               <p>What is that to the purpoſe / that Chryſoſtom ſayth / there muſt be degrees? who denyeth that there are degrees of functions? we confes there is / and ought to be a degree of paſtors / an other of doctors / the third of thoſe whych are called elders / the fourth of deacons. And where he ſayth / there ſhould be one degree of byſhop / another of a miniſter / an other of the lay man / what proueth that for the office of an archbyſhop / whych is your purpoſe to ſhew? how often times muſt you be called <hi>ad Rhombum?</hi> And that he meaneth nothingles / then to make any ſuch difference betwene a byſhop and a miniſter / as is wyth vs / which you wold faine make your reader beleue / I will ſend you to Chryſoſtome / vpon the third chapter. 1. ep. to Timothe / where he ſayeth: The office of a byſhop differeth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing from an elders / and a little after / that a byſhop differeth nothyng from an elder or miniſter / but by the ordination only. Still M. doctor goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in killing a dead man / that is / in confuting that / whych all men condemne / and prouing that whych no man denyeth / that there muſt be ſuperiority amongſt men / and that equality of all men a like / confoundeth all / and ouerthroweth all.</p>
               <p>Thys is a notable argument / there muſt be ſome ſuperior among men: <hi>ergo,</hi> one miniſter muſt be ſuperior to an other. Again / there muſt be in the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctions / ſome degrees: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there muſt be an archbiſhop ouer the whole prouince / or a biſhop ouer the whole dioceſe. And all be it M. doctor taketh great paine to proue that whych no man denyeth / yet he doth it ſo euill fauoredly / and ſo vnfitly / as that if a man had no better proufes then he bringeth / the degrees of the eccleſiaſticall functions / myght fall to the ground. For heere to proue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the eccleſiaſticall functions / he bryngeth in that / that Chryſoſtom ſayth / there muſt be magiſtrate and ſubiect / hym that commaundeth / and hym that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth.</p>
               <p>The moſt therefore that he can conclude of thys / for the myniſtery / is / that there muſt be miniſter that ſhall rule / and people that ſhall be obedient / and heereby he can not proue that there ſhould be any degrees amongſt the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters / and eccleſiaſticall gouernors / vnles he will ſay peraduenture / that as there are vnder Magiſtrates / and a king aboue them all / ſo there ſhould be vnder
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21261:57"/> myniſters / and one myniſter aboue them all. But he muſt remember that it is not neceſſary in a common wealth / that there ſhould be one ouer all / for that there are other good common wealthes / wherein many haue lyke power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And further / if becauſe there is one king in a lande aboue all / he will conclude there ſhould be one archbyſhop ouer all: I ſay / as I haue ſayde / that it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt any word of God which I know (although it be inconuenient) but that there may be one Ceſar ouer all the world / and yet I thinke M. Doctor will not ſay / that there may be one archbyſhop ouer all the world.</p>
               <p>Now M. Doctor commeth to hys olde hole / where he woulde fayne hyde hym ſelfe / and with hym all the ambition / tyranny / and exceſſe of authoritie / which is ioyned wyth theſe functions of archbyſhoppe / and byſhoppe / as they are now vſed: and thys hys hole is / that all the myniſters are equall with byſhops / and archbyſhops / as touching the myniſterie of the worde and ſacramentes / but not as touching pollicie and gouernment. The papiſtes vſe the very ſelfe ſame diſtinction / for the mayntenance of the Popes tyranny and ambytion / and other their hierarchie.</p>
               <p>Maiſter Doctor hath put out the marke / and conceled the name of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes / and ſo with a little chaunge of wordes / as it were with certayne new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loures / he woulde deceiue vs. For the papiſtes ſaye / that euery ſyr Iohn or hedge prieſt / hath as great authoritie to ſacrifice and offer for the quicke and the dead / and to myniſter the ſacramentes as the Pope of Rome hath / but for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment / and for order / the byſhoppe is aboue a prieſt / the archbyſhoppe aboue a byſhoppe / and the Pope aboue them all. But I haue declared before out of the ſcriptures / how vayne a diſtinction it is / and it appeareth out of Cyprian / that as all the byſhops were equall one to an other / ſo he ſayth / that to euery one was geuen a portion of the Lordes flocke / not only to feede with the worde and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes / but to rule and gouerne / not as they which ſhall make any accoumpte vnto an archbyſhop / or be iudged of hym / but as they which can not bee iudged of any / but of God. And Ierome vpon Titus ſayeth / that the elder or myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter dyd gouerne and rule in common with the byſhops / the churche whereof he was elder or myniſter.</p>
               <p>After followeth M. Caluin / a great patrone forſoth / of the archbyſhop / or of thys kynde of byſhop which is vſed amongſt vs heere in Englande. And heere to paſſe ouer your ſtraunge cytations and quotations which you make / to put your anſwerer to payne / ſending hym ſometymes to Muſculus common places for one ſentence / to Auguſtines workes / to Chryſoſtomes workes / to Cyrill / to Maiſter Foxe / and heere ſending hym to the viij. chapter of the inſtitutions / as though you had neuer red Caluins inſtitutions / but tooke the ſentence of ſome bodye elſe / withoute anye examination / whereby it ſeemeth that you were lothe that euer any man ſhould anſwere your booke / letting I ſay all thys paſſe / what maketh thys eyther to proue that there ſhoulde bee one archbyſhoppe ouer all the myniſters in the prouince / or one byſhoppe ouer all in the dioceſe / that amongſt twelue / that were gathered together into one place / there was one which ruled the action / for which they mette? And that it may appeare what ſuperioritie it is / which is lawfull amongſt the myniſters / and what it is that M. Caluin ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of / what alſo the fathers and councels doe meane / when they geue more to the byſhoppe of any one church / then to the elder of the ſame church / and that no man be deceiued by the name of gouernoure or ruler ouer the reſt / to fancie any ſuch authoritie and domination or Lordſhip / as we ſee vſed in our church / it is to be vnderſtanded / that amongſt the paſtors / elders and deacons of euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulare church / and in the meetinges and companies of the myniſters or elders of dyuers churches / there was one choſen by the voyces and ſuffrages of them all / or the moſt part / which did propound the matters that were to be handled / whether
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21261:58"/> they were difficulties to be ſoluted / or puniſhmentes and cenſures to be decreed vpon thoſe which had faulted / or whether there were elections to be made / or what other matter ſo euer occaſion was geuen to entreate of / the which alſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the voyces and reaſons of thoſe which had intereſt to ſpeake in ſuch caſes / whiche alſo did pronounce according to the number of the voyces whiche were geuen / which was alſo the mouth of the reſt / to admoniſhe / or to comfort / or to rebuke ſharply / ſuch as were to receiue admoniſhment conſolation / or rebuke / and which in a worde dyd moderate that whole action / which was done for the time they were aſſembled: which thing we do not deny / may be / but affirme that it is fitte &amp; neceſſary to be / to the auoyding of confuſion. For it were an abſurde hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that many ſhould at once attempt to ſpeake / neyther coulde it be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great reproch / that many men beginning to ſpeake / ſome ſhould be bidden to holde their peace / which would come to paſſe / if there ſhould be no order kept / nor none to appoynt / when euery one ſhould ſpeake or not / to put them to ſilence / when they attempted confuſedly to ſpeake / and out of order. Moreouer when many miniſters mete together / and in ſo great dyuerſitie of giftes as the Lorde hath geuen to hys church / there be founde that excell in memory / facilitie of tong / and expedition or quickneſſe to diſpatche matters more then the reſt / and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is fitt / that the brethren that haue that dexteritie / ſhoulde eſpecially be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto thys office / that the action may be the better / and more ſpedely made an ende of.</p>
               <p>And if any man will call thys a rule or preſidentſhip / and hym that execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thys office a preſident or moderator / or a gouernour / we will not ſtriue / ſo that it be with theſe cautions / that he be not called ſimply gouernor or modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor / but gouernor or moderator of that action / and for that time / and ſubiect to the orders that others be / &amp; to be cenſured by the company of the brethren / as wel as others / if he be iudged any way faulty. And that after that action ended / &amp; mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diſſolued / he ſitte hym downe in hys olde place / and ſet hym ſelfe in equall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate with the reſt of the miniſters. Thirdly / that thys gouernment or preſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip / or what ſo euer lyke name you will geue it / be not ſo tyed vnto that miniſter / but that at the next meeting it ſhall be lawfull to take an other / if an other bee thought meeter. Of thys order and pollicy of the church / if we will ſee a liuely i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and perfect paterne / let vs ſet before our eyes / the moſt auncient and goſpel like church that euer was or ſhall be.</p>
               <p>In the actes / the church being gathered together for the election of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle into the place of Iudas the traytor / when as the intereſt of election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed vnto all / and to the apoſtles eſpecially aboue the reſt / out of the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Peter riſeth vp / telleth the cauſe of their comming together / with what <note place="margin">1. Act. 15.</note> cautions and qualities they ought to chuſe an other / conceyueth the prayer wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the helpe of God in that election / and his direction is begged / and no doubt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted the reſidue of the things which pertayned vnto the whole action.</p>
               <p>In the ſeconde of the actes / all the Apoſtles are accuſed of drunkenneſſe / Peter anſweareth for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all / wypeth away the infamy they were charged with. But you will ſay / where are the voyces of the reſt / which did chuſe Peter vnto thys. Firſt / you muſt know that the ſcripture ſetteth not downe euery circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / &amp; then ſurely you do Peter great iniury / that aſke whether he were choſen vnto it. For is it to bee thought / that Peter would thruſt in hym ſelfe to this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or dignitie without the conſent and allowance of hys fellowes / and preuent hys fellowes of thys preheminence? vndoubtedly / if it hadde not beene done ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogantly / yet it muſt needes haue a great ſhew of arrogancye / if hee hadde done thys without the conſent of hys fellowes. And heere you ſhall heare what the Scholiaſt ſayth / which gathereth the iudgement of Greke diuines <hi>hora</hi> (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Peter) <hi>panta meta koines auton gnomes poiounta.</hi> Behold / how he doth
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21261:58"/> all with their common conſent. And if any man hereupon will ſay / that Peter exerciſed domination ouer the reſt / or gate any archapoſtleſhip / beſide that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole ſtory of the actes of the apoſtles / and his whole courſe of life doth refute that: the ſame Scholiaſt which I made mention of in the ſame place / ſayth he did nothing / <hi>archikos,</hi> imperiouſly / nothing <hi>meta exouſias,</hi> with domynion or power. Further / I will admoniſhe him to take heede / leaſt if he ſtriue ſo ſore for the archbyſhop / he ſlide or euer he be aware into the tentes of the papiſtes / which vſe theſe places to proue that Peter had authoritie and rule ouer the reſt of the apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And that it may bee vnderſtanded / that thys moderate rule / voyde of all pompe and outward ſhew / was not perpetuall / nor alwayes tyed vnto one man (which were the laſt poyntes of the cautions I put before) turne vnto the 15. of the Actes / where is ſhewed / how with the reſt of the church / the apoſtles / and amongſt them Peter being aſſembled to decide a great controuerſie / Iames the <note place="margin">Act. 15. 13.</note> Apoſtle / and not Peter / moderated and gouerned the whole action / when as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other had ſayd their iudgementes / and namely Paule and Barnabas / &amp; Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / he in the ende / in the name of all / pronounced the ſentence / and that whereof the reſt agreed / and had diſputed vnto / and the reſidue reſted in that iudgement / the which alſo may likewyſe appeare in the 21. of the Actes. This is hee which <note place="margin">Act. 21. 20.</note> is called the byſhop in euery church / thys is he alſo whome Iuſtin wherof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made afterwardes / calleth <hi>proeſtos.</hi> And finally / thys is that great archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppricke / and great biſhoppricke that M. Doctor ſo often ſtumbleth on. This order and preheminence / the Apoſtles time / and thoſe that were neare them kept / and the nearer they came to the apoſtles times / the nearer they kept them to this order / and the farther of they were from thoſe times / vntill the diſcouering of the ſonne of perdition / the further of were they from thys moderation / and nearer to that tyranny and ambitious power / which oppreſſed and ouerlayde the churche of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore maiſter Caluin doth warely ſay / that one amongſt the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles indefinitely / not any one ſingular perſon (as Peter) had the moderation and rule of the other / and further ſhadoweth out what rule that was / by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the conſul of Rome / whoſe authoritie was / to gather the ſenate together / &amp; to tell of the matters which were to be handled / to gather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voyces / to pronounce the ſentence. And although the Antichriſt of Rome had peruerted all good order / and taken all libertie of the church into hys / the Cardinalles / Archbiſhops / and Byſhoppes handes / yet there are ſome colde and lyght footinges of it in our ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes / which are holden with the parliament / where amongſt all the myniſters which are aſſembled out of all the whole realme / by the more part of voyces / one to choſen which ſhould goe before the reſt / propounde the cauſes / gather the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / and bee as it were the mouth of the whole company / whome they terme the prolocutor. Suche great force hath the truthe / that in the vtter ruines of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery / it could neuer be ſo pulled vp by the rootes that a man coulde neuer know the place thereof no more / or that it ſhoulde not leaue ſuche markes and printes behinde it / whereby it myght afterwardes recouer it ſelfe / and come agayne to the knowledge of men.</p>
               <p>Now you ſee what authoritie we allow amongſt the miniſters / both in their ſeuerall churches / or in prouinciall ſinodes / or nationall / or generall / or what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer other meetinges ſhall be aduiſed of for the profite and edifying of the church / and withall you ſee / that as we are farre from thys tyranny and exceſſiue power which now is in the church / ſo we are (by the grace of God) as farre from confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſorder / wherein you trauell ſo much to make vs to ſeeme giltie.</p>
               <p>M. Doctor reaſoneth agayne / that Paule an Apoſtle / and in the higheſt degree of miniſterie / was ſuperior to Timothe and Titus Euangeliſtes / and ſo in a lower degree of myniſterie / therefore one myniſter is ſuperior to an other / 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21261:59"/> one byſhop to an other byſhop / whych are all one office / and one function. As if I ſhuld ſay my Lord Mayor of London is aboue the ſherifes / therfore one ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife is ſuperior to an other. Again / an other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he hath of the ſame ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. Titus being an Euangeliſt / was ſuperior to al the paſtors in Crete / which was a degree vnder the Euangeliſts / therfore one paſtor muſt be ſuperior vnto an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſtor. And that he was ſuperior / he proueth becauſe he had authority to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine paſtors / ſo that the print of the archbyſhop is ſo deepely ſet in his head / that hereof he can imagine nothing / but that Titus ſhuld be archbiſhop of all Crete.</p>
               <p>I haue ſhewed before / how theſe words are to be taken of S. Paule: and for ſo much as M. Doctor burdeneth vs wyth the authority of Caluin ſo often / I wil ſend him to Caluins owne interpretation vpon this place / wher he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Titus did not ordaine by his owne authority / for ſ. Paul wold not graunt Titus leaue to do that / whych he him ſelf wold not / and ſheweth that to ſay that Titus ſhould make the election of paſtors by him ſelfe / is to giue vnto hym a princely authority / and to take away the election from the church / and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the inſufficiency of the miniſter from the company of the paſtors / whych were (ſayeth he) to prophane the whole gouernment of the church.</p>
               <p>I maruell therfore what M. doctor meaneth to be ſo buſy wyth M. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin / and to ſeke confirmation of his archbyſhop and byſhop at him / whych wold haue ſhaken at the naming of the one / and trembled at the office of the other / on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it be becauſe he would faine haue hys plaiſter where he receiued hys wound / but I dare aſſure him / that in his garden / he ſhall neuer finde the herbe that wil heale him. And becauſe that the ſcriptures when they make for our cauſe / receiue this anſwer commonly / that they ſerued but for the apoſtles times / and M. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins authority will wey nothing as I thinke wyth M. Doctor / when he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by vs againſt hym / I wil ſend hym to the Greke Scholiaſte / whych vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place of Titus ſayth after this ſort. He would not (ſpeaking of ſ. Paule) haue the whole Ile of Crete / miniſtred and gouerned by one / but that euery one ſhould haue hys proper charge and care / for ſo ſhould Titus haue a lighter la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor / and the people that are gouerned / ſhould enioy greater attendance of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor / whileſt he that teacheth them / doth not run about the gouernment of many congregations / but attendeth vnto one / and garniſheth that.</p>
               <p>Now M. Doctor may ſee by this / that Titus (by the iudgement of the Scholiaſte) was not as he fanſieth / the archbyſhop of all Crete / but that he had one flocke / whervpon (for the time he was there) he attended. And that where it is ſayd he ordained miniſters / it is nothing elſe / but that he was the cheefe and the moderator in the election of the miniſters / as I haue declared before by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples. And it is no maruell / although the reſt graunted hym thys prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence / when he had both moſt excellent gifts / and was a degree aboue the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors / being an Euangeliſt.</p>
               <p>Vnto the place of Timothe / where he willeth him not to admit an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt an elder vnder two or three witneſſes / I anſwer as I haue done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the place of Titus / that is / that as the ordination of the paſtors is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto Titus and Timothe / becauſe they gouerned and moderated that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / and were the firſt in it / ſo alſo is the depoſing or other cenſures of them / and that for as much as he wryteth hys epiſtles vnto Timothe &amp; Titus / he telleth them how they ſhould behaue them ſelues in their office / and doth not ſhut out other from this cenſure and iudgement. And it is more agreable to the inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the epiſtles / that he ſhould ſay (admit not thou / or ordain not thou) wryting vnto one / then if he ſhould ſay (ordaine not ye / or admit not ye) as if he ſhould wryte to many / for ſo ſhould neyther the ending agree wyth the beginning / nor the midſt wyth them both. And if this be a good rule / that becauſe Paul biddeth Timothe and Titus to iudge of the faults of the paſtors / and to ordain paſtors / 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21261:59"/> therfore none elſe did but they: Then whereas S. Paule biddeth Timothe that <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 8. 1:</note> he ſhould commaund &amp; teach / that godlines is profitable to all things / &amp; admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth him to be an example of the whole flocke / by your reaſon he wil haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myniſters of Epheſus / or of the Ile of Creta / to teach that doctrine / or to be examples to their flockes / &amp; an hundreth ſuch things in the Epiſtles of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe and Titus / which although they be there particularly directed vnto Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe / and Titus / yet do they agree / &amp; are common to them / with all other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters / yea ſometimes vnto the whole flocke.</p>
               <p>As for Epiphanius / it is knowne of what authoritie he is in this place / when as by Aerius ſides / he goeth about to pricke at the Apoſtle / whileſt he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to confute the Apoſtle which maketh a diſtinction and difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene thoſe which the Apoſtle maketh one / that is / a byſhop and an elder / and to ſpare the credite of Epiphanius / it were better lay that opinion vpon ſome <hi>Pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depiphanius,</hi> that is to ſay counterfaite / which we may do / not without great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie / ſeeing <note n="*" place="margin">Ad quod vult Deum.</note> Auguſtine ſayth / that the true Epiphanius vttereth all after a ſtory faſhion / and doth not vſe any diſputation / or reaſoning for the truth agaynſt the falſhode / and thys Epiphanius is very full of argumentes and reaſons / the choyſe whereof M. Doctor hath taken.</p>
               <p>And whereas M. Doctor citeth Ambroſe / Caluin / and other godly wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters / to proue that the myniſter is vnderſtanded by the word elder or <hi>presbiter,</hi> he keepeth hys olde wont / by bringing ſtickes into the woode / and prouing alwayes that which no man denyeth: and yet with the myniſter of the word / he alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the elder of the church which ruleth / and doth not labor in the word. But therein is not the matter / for I doe graunt that by <hi>presbiter,</hi> the myniſter of the word is vnderſtanded / &amp; yet nothing proued of that which M. Doctor would ſo fayne proue. It is no maruell although you take vp the authors of the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition for want of logicke / for you vtter great ſkill your ſelfe in wryting / which keepe no order / but confound your reader in that thing / which euen the common logicke of the countrey / which is reaſon / might haue directed you in. For what a confuſion of times is thys / to begin with Cyprian / and then come to Ierome and Chryſoſtome / and after to the ſcripture / and backe agayne to Ignatius / that was before Cyprian / which times are ill diſpoſed of you / and that in a matter wherein it ſtode you vpon to haue obſerued the order of the tymes. But as for Ignatius place it is ſufficiently anſwered before in that which was anſwered to Cyprian hys place / for when he ſayth the byſhop hath rule ouer all / he meaneth no more all in the prouince / then in all the worlde / but meaneth that flocke &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation / whereof he is byſhop or myniſter. And when he calleth hym prince of the prieſtes / although the title be to exceſſiue and bigge / condemned by Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and the councell of Carthage / yet he meaneth no more the prince of all in the dioceſe as we take it / or of the prouince / then he meaneth the Prince of all the prieſtes in the world: but thoſe fellow myniſters and elders that had the rule and gouernment of that particulare church and congregation / whereof he was by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop / as the great churches haue for the moſt part both elders which gouerne on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / and myniſters alſo to ayde one an other / and the principalitie that hee which they called the byſhop had ouer the reſt / hath bene before at large declared.</p>
               <p>But M. Doctor doth not remember that whileſt hee thus reaſoneth for the authoritie of the byſhoppe / hee ouerthroweth hys archbyſhoppe quite and cleane / for Ignatius will haue none aboue the byſhop but Chriſt / and hee will haue an archbyſhop.</p>
               <p>I ſee a man can not well ſerue two maiſters / but eyther he muſt diſpleaſe the one / and pleaſe the other / or by pleaſing of one / offend the other. For M. Doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tor would fayne pleaſe / and vpholde both / and yet hys proufes are ſuch / that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery prop that he ſetteth vnder one / is an axe to ſtrike at the other. But that M.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21261:60"/> D. delyteth alwayes wher he might fetch at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fountaine / to be raking in ditches / he needed not to haue gone to Iuſtin Martyr for <hi>Proeſtos,</hi> when as S. Paule <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> calleth the myniſters &amp; Elders by thys title. And if thys place of Iuſtin make for an archbyſhop / then in ſtead of an archbyſhop in euery prouince / we ſhal haue one in euery congregation. For Iuſtin declareth there / the Leyturgie or maner of ſeruing God that was in euery church vſed of the Chriſtians. And I pray you let it be conſidered / what is the office of that <hi>proeſtos,</hi> and ſee whether there be any reſemblance in the world / betwene hym and an archbyſhop. For he placeth hys office to be in preaching / in conceiuing prayers / in myniſtring of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Of any commaundement which he had ouer the reſt of the myniſters / or of any ſuch priuiledges as the archbyſhop hath / he maketh not one worde. It may be / that the ſame myght haue the preheminence of calling the reſt together / and propounding the matter to the reſt of the company / and ſuch lyke as is before declared. As ſoone as euer you found <hi>proeſtos,</hi> you ſnatched that by and by / and went your wayes / and ſo deceyue your ſelfe and others. But if you had red the whole treatiſe / you ſhould haue founde that he was <hi>proeſtos,</hi> of the people / for thus it is written in the ſame Apologie / <hi>Epeita proſpheretai to Proeſtoti ton ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elphon artos.</hi> Afterwarde bread is brought to the preſident of the brethren cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the people as S. Paule doth continually brethren. And therefore theſe are M. Doctors argumentes oute of Martyrs place. There was a myniſter which dyd ſtande before / or was preſident of the reſt in euery particulare church and congregation / therefore there was an archbyſhoppe ouer all the prouince. And agayne / there was one which ruled the people in euery congregation / ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was one that ruled all the myniſters through out the whole prouince. And albeit things were in great puritie in the dayes that Iuſtin liued / in reſpect of the tymes which followed / yet as there was in other things (which appeare in hys workes / and euen in the miniſtration of the ſacramentes ſpoken of in that place) corruption / in that they mingled water and wine together / ſo euen in the miniſterie / there began to peepe out ſome thing which went from the ſimplicitie of the goſpel / as that the name of <hi>proeſtos,</hi> which was common to the elders with the miniſters of the word / was (as it ſeemeth) appropriated vnto one.</p>
               <p>Another of M. Doctors reaſons / for to proue the archbyſhop / is / that Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill maketh mention of an high prieſt / wherunto I anſwere / that he that bringeth in a prieſt into the church / goeth about to bury our ſauiour Chriſt / for although it myght be proued that the worde prieſt were the ſame with the Greekes <hi>pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteros,</hi> yet (as ſhall appeare in hys place) is the vſe of thys word (prieſt) for a myniſter of the goſpell very daungerous. And as for hym that bringeth in an high prieſt into the church / hee goeth about to put our ſauiour Chriſt out of hys office / who is proued in the Epiſtle to the Hebrues to be the only high prieſt / and <note place="margin">Hebru. 7.</note> that there can be no more as long as the worlde endureth. And yet if all thys were graunted / you are not yet come to that which you deſire to proue / that is / an archbyſhoppe. For if you looke in Theodorete / you ſhall fynde thys woorde <note place="margin">1. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>archieroſyne,</hi> which ſignifyeth the highe prieſthoode / to be nothing elſe but a byſhoppricke / and in the. 7. chapter of that booke / and ſo forth dyuers tymes / you ſhall haue <hi>archiereus,</hi> taken for a byſhop / as ſpeaking of the councel of Nice / he ſayth that there was. 318. <hi>archiereis,</hi> highe prieſtes. Now I thincke you wil not ſay there were. 318. archbyſhops. If you do / you are confuted by all eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall wryters that euer I red / which ſpeaking of them / call them byſhops.</p>
               <p>Chryſoſtome followeth / which as M. Doctor ſayth / ruled not only the church of Conſtantinople / but the churches of Thracia / Aſia / and Pontus / &amp; he ſayth it out of Theodorete. But heerin it may appeare / that eyther M. Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hath a very euill conſcience in falſifying wryters / &amp; that in the poyntes which he in controuerſie / or elſe he hath taken hys ſtuffe of certayne at the ſeconde hand
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21261:60"/> without any examination of it at all. For heere he hath ſet downe in ſtead of (had care of the churches in Thracia. &amp;c.) ruled the churches / the Greke is / <hi>epoieito ten promethcian,</hi> it is tranſlated alſo <hi>(proſpexit)</hi> ſo that it appeareth he fetched it neyther from Theodorite in Greeke nor in Latine. And what is thys to proue an archbyſhoppe / that he had care of theſe churches? there is no miniſter but ought to haue care ouer all the churches through chriſtendome / and to ſhew that care for them / in comforting or admoniſhing of them by wryting / or by viſiting them / if the neceſſitie ſo require / and it be thought good by the churches / and leaue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned of the place where he is myniſter / vppon ſome notable and eſpeciall cauſe / being ſome man of ſingular giftes / whoſe learning and credite may profite much to the bringing to paſſe of that thing / for the which he is to be ſent. After thys ſort * S. Cyprian being in Affricke / had care ouer Rome in Europe / and wrote <note place="margin">As it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by diuers epiſtles of his. <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.</note> vnto the church there. After thys ſort alſo was * Ireneus byſhoppe of Lions / ſent by the French churches vnto the churches in Phrigia. And after thys ſort haue M. Caluin / and M. Beza bene ſent from Geneua in Sauoy / to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Fraunce.</p>
               <p>Now / if you will conclude heereupon / that Cyprian ruled the churche of Rome / or Ireneus the churches of Phrigia / or maiſter Caluin / or M. Beza the churches of Fraunce / or that they were byſhops or archbyſhops of thoſe places / you ſhall but conclude as you were wont to doe / but yet all men vnderſtand / that heere is nothing leſſe then an archbyſhop / or any ſuch byſhoppe / as we haue and vſe in our church. And if ſo be that Chryſoſtome ſhould be byſhop or archbyſhop of al theſe churches which were in al Aſia / Pontus / Thracia / as you wold geue the reader to vnderſtand / you make hym byſhop of more churches / then euer the Pope of Rome was / when he was in hys greateſt pryde / and hys Empire lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt. For there were ſixe preſidentſhips in Thracia / and in Aſia there were a ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Princes / and had ſeuerall regions or gouernmentes / and in Pontus as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny / and if he were byſhop or archbyſhop of all the churches within theſe domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons / he had neede of a long ſpone to feede with all. It is certayne therefore / that he was byſhop only of the church in Conſtantinople / and had an eye &amp; a care to thoſe other churches. And that he was byſhop of one citie / or of one church / it may appeare by that which I haue before alleaged oute of the Greeke Scholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſte vpon Titus / who citeth there Chryſoſtome / where it is ſayd that S.

               <p>Touching Theodorete byſhop of Cyrus / to let pas that which the biſhops of Egipt cryed in the councell of Calcedon / that he was no biſhop / it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued / <note place="margin">In the 1. act.

               <p>Now / that it may appeare what great lykelyhoode there is betwene thys Theodoret / and our Lord byſhops and archbyſhops / it is to be conſidered which he wryteth of hym ſelfe in the Epiſtle vnto Leo / that is / that he hauing bene. 26. yeares byſhop / was knowne of all that dwelt in thoſe partes / that he had neuer houſe of hys owne / nor field / nor halfepennie / not ſo much as a place to be buryed in / but had willingly contented hym ſelfe with a poore eſtate / belyke he had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leane archbyſhoppricke.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21261:61"/> the myniſters / and of the vniuerſities / which are the ſeede of the myniſterie / I thincke the heate of the diſputation / and contention for archbyſhops and biſhops / would be cooled.</p>
               <p>Now good reader thou heareſt what M. Doctor hath bene able to take together out of the olde fathers / which he ſayth are ſo playne in thys matter / and yet can ſhew nothing to the purpoſe. Heare alſo what he ſayth out of the wryters of our age / all which he ſayth (except one or two) are of hys iudgement / and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low well of thys diſtinction of degrees.</p>
               <p>Maiſter Caluin firſt is cited / to proue thoſe offices of archbyſhop / primate / patriarche / the names whereof he can not abyde / and as for hym he approueth only / that there ſhould be ſome <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which when difficult cauſes ariſe / which can not bee ended in the particulare churches might referre the matters to ſinodes and prouinciall councels and which myght do the offices which I haue ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of gathering voyces. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But that he lyketh not of thoſe dominations and large iuriſdictions or at all of the byſhoppes or archbyſhops / which we haue now / it may appeare playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough / both in that place / when as he will haue hys wordes drawen to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the olde byſhoppes / ſhutting out thereby the byſhoppes that now are / as alſo in other places / and namely vpon the Philippians / where (reaſoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt <note place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> thys diſtinction betwene paſtor and byſhop / and ſhewing that geuing the name of byſhop to one man only in a church / was the occaſion why he afterward vſurped domynation ouer the reſt) he ſayth after thys ſort: In deede I graunt (ſayth he) as the diſpoſitions and manners of men are / order can not ſtande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the myniſters of the woorde / vnleſſe one be ouer the reſt / I meane (ſayth he) of euery ſeuerall and ſinguler body / not of a whole prouince / much leſſe of the whole worlde.</p>
               <p>Now if you will needes haue M. Caluins archbyſhop / you muſt not haue hym neyther ouer a prouince nor dioceſe / but only ouer one ſinguler and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler congregation. How much better therefore were it for you to ſeeke ſome other ſhelter againſt the ſtorme then maiſter Caluins / which will not ſuffer you by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes to couer your ſelfe vnder hys winges / but thruſteth you out alwayes as ſoone as you enter vpon him forceably.</p>
               <p>But heere I can not let paſſe M. Doctors ill dealing / which recyting ſo much of maiſter Caluin / cutteth hym of in the waſte and leaueth quite out that which made agaynſt hym / that is which maiſter Caluin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then followeth Hemingius / who you ſay approueth theſe degrees of arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop / metropolitane / byſhop / archdeacon / for ſo you muſt needes meane / when you ſay he approueth theſe degrees / or els you ſay nothing / for there vpon is the queſtion. Now how vntruely you ſpeake (let it be iudged by that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. * Firſt he ſayth that our ſauiour Chriſt in S.

Here you ſee / not only how he is agaynſt you in your expoſition in the place of S.

And afterward ſpeaking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches of Denmarke / he ſayth they haue Chriſt for their head &amp; for the outwarde diſcipline / they haue magiſtrates to puniſh with the ſword / &amp; for to exerciſe the Eccleſiaſticall diſciplyne / they haue bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops / paſtors / doctors / which may keepe men vnder with the word / without v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any corporall puniſhment. Here is no mention of archbyſhops / Primates
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21261:61"/> metropolitanes. And although he ſheweth that they kepe the diſtinction betwene byſhops and miniſters / againſt whych there hath bene before ſpoken: yet he ſayth that the authority which they haue / is as the authority of a father / not as the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of a maiſter / whych is far otherwiſe heere. For the condition of many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts vnder their maiſters / is much more free then the condition of a miniſter vnder hys byſhop. And afterward he ſheweth wherin that authority or dignity of the byſhop ouer the miniſter lyeth / that is in exhorting of him / in chiding of hym / as he doth the lay people / and yet he will haue alſo the miniſter / although not with ſuch authority / after a modeſt ſort to do the ſame vnto the byſhop. And ſo he concludeth / that they retain theſe orders / notwithſtanding the anabaptiſts. Now let the reader iudge / whether Hemingius be truely or faithfully alledged or no / or whether Hemingius do ſay that they haue in their church archbiſhops / primates / metropolitanes / archdeacons / or whether the byſhops in the churches of Denmarke / are any thing like oures. For I will omit that he ſpeaketh there againſt all pomp in the miniſtery / all worldly ſuperiority or highnes / becauſe I loue not to wryte out whole pages / as M.

               <p>M. doctor cloſeth vp this matter wyth M. Foxe / but eyther for feare that the place ſhould be found that there might be anſwer / or for feare that M.

You make me ſuſpect that your praiſe is not harty / but pretended / becauſe you do ſo often &amp; ſo bitterly ſpeake againſt all thoſe that will not receiue the cap and ſurplice / and other ceremonies / wherof M. Fox declareth his great miſliking. For anſwer vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place / becauſe I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber it not / nor meane not to read ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole boke to ſeeke it / I ſay firſt as I ſaid before / that there may be ſome thing before or after / which may geue the ſolution to this place / eſpecially ſeeing M.

Moreouer I ſay / that M.

Laſt of all / if any thing be ſpoken there to the hinderance of the ſincerity of the goſpell / I am well aſſured that M. Foxe / whych hath trauailed ſo much and ſo profitably to that end / will not haue hys authority or name therin to bring any preiudice. Now wil I alſo wyne with you / and leaue it to the iudgement of the indifferent reader / how well out of the ſcriptures / councels / wryters old and new / you haue proued either the lawfulnes
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21261:62"/> at all of the names of archbiſhops / patriarches / archdeacons / primates / or of the lawfulnes of the office of them / and of byſhops whych be in our times.</p>
               <p>And for as much as I haue purpoſed to anſwer in one place / that which is ſcattered in diuers / I will heere anſwere halfe a ſhete of paper / whych is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of late vnto thys boke put forthe in the name / and vnder the credite of the B. of Saliſbury. Wherin I wil ſay nothyng of thoſe byting &amp; ſharpe words / which are giuen partly in the beginning / when he calleth the propounders of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition whych concerneth archbyſhops and archdeacons nouices / partly in the end when he calleth them children / and the doctrine of the goſpell wantonnes. &amp;c. If he had liued / for hys learning and grauitye / and otherwyſe good deſertes of the church / in defending the cauſe therof agaynſt the papiſtes / we coulde haue eaſely borne it at hys handes: nowe he is deade and layde vp in peace / it were agaynſte all humanitye to dygge or to breake vp hys graue / only I wil leaue it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the reader vpon thoſe things whych are alledged / to iudge / whether it be any wantonnes or noueltye whych is confirmed by ſo graue teſtimonyes of the auncient worde of God. Vnto the place of the. 4. of the Epheſians before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged / he anſweareth cleane contrary to that whych M. Doctor ſayth / that we haue nowe neyther Apoſtles / nor Euangeliſts / nor Prophets / wherevppon he wold conclude that that place is no perfect paterne of the miniſtery in the church. In deede it is true / we haue not / neyther is it nedefull that wee ſhould. It was therfore ſufficient that there were once / and for a time / ſo that the wante of thoſe nowe / is no cauſe whye the minyſteries there recited / be not ſufficient for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complyſhment and full fyniſhing of the church / nor cauſe whye anye other miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries ſhould be added / beſydes thoſe whych are there recyted.</p>
               <p>Afterward he ſaith / that neither byſhop nor elder are reckned in that place. The paſtor is there reckened vp / and I haue ſhewed / that the paſtor and byſhop / are all one / and are but dyuers names to ſignifye one thyng. And as for thoſe el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders whych doe only gouerne / they are made mention of in other places / the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles purpoſe being to recken vp here only / thoſe minyſteries / whych are conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the worde as I haue before alledged / and therefore the byſhop and elder whych wyth gouernment teache alſo are there contained.</p>
               <p>After that / he ſayeth there is no <hi>catechiſta,</hi> if there be a paſtor / or as ſome thynke Doctor / there is one whych bothe can / and ought to inſtruct the youth / neyther doth it pertayne to any other in the churche / and publykely to teache the youth in the rudiments of religion / then vnto eyther the paſtor or doctor / how ſo euer in ſome times and places / they haue made a ſeuerall office of it.</p>
               <p>And where he ſayth that there is neyther deacon nor reader mentioned / for the deacon I haue anſweared that ſ. Paul ſpeaketh there only of thoſe functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s whych are occupyed both in teachyng and gouernyng the churches / and therfore there was no place there to ſpeake of a deacon / and as for the reader / it is no ſuch office in the churche / whych the miniſter may not doe. And if eyther he haue not leyſure / or his ſtrength and voyce wil not ſerue hym / firſt to read ſome long time / and afterwarde to preache: it is an eaſye matter to appoynt ſome of the elders or deacons / or ſome other graue man in the church to that purpoſe / as it hathe bene practiſed in the churches in times paſt / and is in the churches reformed in oure dayes without making any new order or office of the miniſtery. Where he ſayth / that by thys reaſon we ſhould haue no churches / pulpits / ſchooles / nor vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: it is firſt eaſely anſweared that S. Paule ſpeaketh not in the. 4. to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians / of all things neceſſary for the churche / but only of all neceſſary eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall functions / whych do both teach &amp; gouerne in the church / and then I haue already ſhewed that there were both churches and pulpits.</p>
               <p>As for ſcholes and vniuerſities / it is ſufficient commaundement of them / in that it is commaunded / that bothe the magiſtrates and paſtors ſhould be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21261:62"/>
/ for he that commaundeth that they ſhoulde be learned / commaundeth thoſe things and thoſe meanes / wherby they may moſt conueniently come to that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And we haue alſo examples of them commended vnto vs in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As in the boke of the Iudges / when Debora commendeth the vniuerſity <note place="margin">Iudges. 5. 14.</note> men / and thoſe whych handled the pen of the wryter / that they came out to helpe in the battell againſt the enemies of God. And in the boke of Samuel / and of the <note place="margin">1. Sam. 19. 19 2. reg. 2. 3. 5. 7.</note> Kings / where Nayothe and Bethel / Ierycho / and a place beyond Iordan / are ſpecified places / whych were ſcholes or vniuerſities / where the ſchollers of the Prophets / were brought vp in the feare of God / and good learning. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce of whych ſcholes and vniuerſities amongſte the people of God / maye be eaſely gathered of that whych S. Luke wryteth in the Actes / where it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <note place="margin">Actes. 6. 9.</note> that in Ieruſalem there were certen Colledges appoynted for ſeuerall countrey men / ſo that there was one Colledge to receiue the Iewes and Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites whych came out of Cilicia / an other for thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came out of Alexandria. &amp;c. to ſtudy at Ieruſalem. And if any man be able to ſhew ſuch euidence for archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and archdeacons / as theſe are for vniuerſities and ſcholes / I wil not deny but it is as lawfull to haue them / as theſe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore / he ſayeth that the church is not gouerned by names / but by offices: ſo is it in deede. And if the office of an archbyſhop or archdeacon can be ſhewed / we will not ſtriue for the name / but for ſo much as all the nedefull offices of the church togither wyth their names / are mentioned in the ſcripture / it is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſayde / that bothe the offices and names of archbyſhop and archdeacon / (being not only not contained in them / but alſo conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned) ought to be baniſhed out of the churche.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all / he ſayth / that Anacletus (if there be any waight in his words) nameth an archb. I haue before ſhewed what waighte there is in his woordes / and I refuſe not that he be weyghed wyth the byſhops owne weightes / whych he geueth vs in the handling of the article of the ſupremacye / and in the. 223. and 224. pages / by the whych waightes appeareth / that thys Anacletus is not only lyght / but a plaine counterfait.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon whych ſayeth that the churche of God vnder the lawe / had all thyngs needefull appoynted by the commaundement of God / the byſhop ſayeth he knoweth not what could be concluded of it. I haue ſhewed before that there is nothyng les ment / then that the church vnder the goſpell / ſhould haue all thoſe thyngs that that church had / or ſhoulde haue nothing / whych that had not: but thys therevpon is concluded / that the Lord whych was ſo carefull for that / as not to omit the leaſt / would not be ſo careles for this church vnder the goſpel / as to omit the greateſt.</p>
               <p>And where he ſayeth / that there was then whych was called highe prieſt / and was ouer all the reſt: he did well know that the cauſe therof was / becauſe he was a figure of Chriſte / and dyd repreſent vnto the people / the cheefetye and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritye of oure ſauioure Chriſte whych was to come / and that oure ſauioure Chriſte being come / there is nowe no cauſe why there ſhould be any ſuch prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence geuen vnto one: and further / that it is vnlawfull that there ſhoulde be any ſuche / vnles it be lawfull to haue one head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> byſhop ouer all the church. For it is knowne / that that prieſte was the heade prieſt ouer all the whole Churche / whych was during hys time vnto our ſauioure Chriſte. And as for thoſe titles / cheefe of the ſinagogue / cheefe of the ſanctuary / cheefe of the houſe of God / I ſay that that maketh muche agaynſt archbyſhoppes and archdeacons / for when as in ſteade of the ſinagogue / and of the ſanctuarie / and of the houſe of God or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple / are come particulare churches and congregations / by this reaſon it foloweth / that there ſhoulde be ſome cheefe / not in euery prouince or dioceſe / but in euery congregation: and in dede ſo ought there to be certen cheefe in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation / 
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21261:63"/> whych ſhould gouerne and rule the reſt. And as for the cheefe of the families of the Leuites / and cheefe of the families of the prieſtes / the ſame was obſerued in all other tribes of Iſraell as a ciuile thyng. And by all theſe princes ouer euery tribe and family / as by the Prince of the whole land / God did / as it were by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers liuely pictures unprint in their vnderſtanding / the cheefety and domination of our ſauior Chriſt. Moreouer theſe orders and pollicies touching the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the offices of the Leuites and prieſts / and touching the appoyntment of their gouernors / were done of Dauid by the aduiſe of the prophets / Gad &amp; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than / whych receiued of the Lord by commaundement / that whych they deluie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">2. Chro. 29. 25</note> to Dauid. And if ſo be that it can be ſhewed / that archbyſhops and archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons / came into the church by any commaundement of the Lord / then thys alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation hath ſome force / but now being not only not commaunded / but alſo (as I haue ſhewed) forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / euery man doth ſee that this reaſon hath no place / but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to the vtter ouerthrow of the archbyſhop and archdeacon. For if Dauid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a notable perſonage / and as it were an angell of God / durſt not take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to bring into the church any orders or pollicies / not only not againſt the word of God / but not without a preciſe word and commaundement of God / who ſhall dare to be ſo bold / as to take vpon him the inſtitution of the cheefe office of the church / and to alter the pollicy that God hath eſtabliſhed by hys ſeruauntes the apoſtles?</p>
               <p>And where the byſhop ſayth / it is knowne and confeſſed / that there wanted many things to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfection of the church of the Iewes: truely I do not know / nor can not confes / that that church wanted any thing to the perfection of that eſtate / whych the Lord would haue them be in / vntill the comming of our ſauior Chriſt: and if there were any thing wanting / it was not for want of good lawes and pollicies / (wherof the queſtion is / ) but for want of due execution of them / whych we ſpeake not of.</p>
               <p>For the two laſt reaſons againſt the archbyſhop and archdeacon / although I be well acquainted wyth diuers / that fauor this cauſe / yet I did neuer heare them before in my life: and I beleeue they cannot be proued to be hys reaſons / whoſe they are ſuppoſed to be / and whych did ſet downe that propoſition / that the byſhop confuteth. Notwithſtanding / the former of theſe two ſeemeth to haue a good probability / and to be grounded of that place of Logicke / that ſheweth / that according as the ſubiect or ſubſtance of any thing is excellent / ſo are thoſe things that are annexed and adioyned vnto it. But becauſe I wold the ſimpleſt ſhould vnderſtand what is ſayd or written / I will willingly abſtaine from ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons / the termes wherof are not eaſely perceiued / but of thoſe whych be learned.</p>
               <p>And as for the anſwer whych the byſhop maketh / that in place of apoſtles / prophets / the gifts of tongues / of healing / and of gouernment / are brought in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſities / ſcholes / byſhops / and archbyſhops: for ſcholes and vniuerſities / I haue ſhewed / they haue bene alwayes / and therfore can not come in / to ſupply the roume of the apoſtles and prophets. And whether a man conſider the ſchollers that learne / or the ſcholemaiſters whych teach / or the orders appoynted for the gouernment of the ſcholes / they ſhall be found to be rather ciuill then eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: and therfore can not come in ſtead of any eccleſiaſticall miniſtery. If the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop do meane that they come in place of the gift of tongues / and knowledge of the goſpell that was firſt geuen miraculouſly / I graunt it / and then it maketh nothing to this queſtion.</p>
               <p>As for byſhops / they can not come in place of apoſtles or prophets / for as much as they were when the Apoſtles / Euangeliſts / and Prophets were: and are one of thoſe miniſteries / whych S. Paul mentioneth in the. 4. to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians / being the ſame that is the paſtor.</p>
               <p>There remaineth therfore the archbyſhop / whych if he came in place of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21261:63"/> Prophets and apoſtles (as the byſhop ſayeth) howe commeth it to pas / that the byſhop ſayeth by and by oute of the authoritye of Eraſmus / that Titus was an archbyſhop: for at that time / there was bothe apoſtles / prophets / and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts. If it be ſo therfore / that the archbyſhop muſt ſupply the want of apoſtles. &amp;c. howe commeth it to pas / he wayteth not hys time whileſt they were deade / but commeth in / like vnto one whych is borne oute of time / and like the vntimely and haſty frute / whych is ſeldome or neuer wholeſome. And for one to come into the apoſtles or prophets place / requireth the authority of him whych ordained the apoſtles. &amp;c. whych is the Lord / and hys inſtitution in hys word / whych is that whych we deſire to be ſhewed. But heereof I haue ſpoken before at large. The neceſſity of Deanes I do not acknowledge / and I haue already ſpoken of them. Touching Prebendaries / I ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake a worde heereafter. For Earles and Dukes / and ſuch like titles of honor / they are ciuil / neither doth it folowe / that becauſe there may newe titles or newe offices be brought into the ciuile gouernement / that therefore the ſame may be attempted in the church. For God hath left a greater liberty in inſtituting thyngs in the common wealth / then in the churche.</p>
               <p>For / for ſo much as there be diuers common wealthes / and diuers formes of common wealthes / and all good / it falleth oute / that the offices and dignityes whych are good in one common wealth / are not good in an other / as thoſe which are good in a Monarchie / are not good in Ariſtocratie / and thoſe which are good in Ariſtocratie / are not good in a populare ſtate. But that can not be ſayde of the churche / whych is but one and vniforme / and hathe the ſame lawes and forme of gouernment throughout the worlde.</p>
               <p>In common wealths alſo there are conuerſions / one forme being changed into an other / whych can not be in the true church of God. As for Eraſmus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye whych ſayeth that Titus was an archbyſhop / I haue anſweared to it. And whereas Chryſoſtome ſayeth / that the iudgement of many byſhops was committed to Titus / I haue declared in what ſorte that is to be vnderſtanded / and yet vpon thoſe words / the byſhop can hardly conclude / that whych he doth: that Titus had the gouernment of many byſhops. For it is one thing to ſay / the iudgement of many was committed vnto Titus / and an other thyng to ſay / that he had the gouernement of many.</p>
               <p>The anſwer of the byſhop vnto the fourth ſuppoſed reaſon / pertaineth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an other queſtion / that is whether eccleſiaſticall perſons / ought to exerciſe ciuil iuriſdiction / whervnto I will anſwer by Gods grace / when I come to ſpeake vpon occaſion of M. Doctors boke of that queſtion. In the meane ſeaſon I wil deſire the reader to conſider / what weake grounds the archbyſhop and archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con ſtand vpon / ſeeing that the byſhop of Sarum / being ſo learned a man / and of ſo great reading / coulde ſay no more in their defence / whych notwythſtanding in the controuerſies agaynſt D. Harding / is ſo pithy and ſo plentifull.</p>
               <p>Now I haue ſhewed how little thoſe things whych M. doctor bringeth / make for proufe of that wherfore he alledgeth them: I will for the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the reader / ſet downe what were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſes why the archbiſhops were firſt ordained / and what were their prerogatiues / and prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces before other byſhops / and the eſtate alſo of the old byſhops / whych liued in thoſe times / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in althoughe there were great corruptions / yet the church was in ſome tollerable eſtate / to the entent it may appeare / partly how little nede we haue of them now / and partly alſo howe greate difference there is betweene oures and them. Of the names of Metropolitane / it hath bene ſpoken / howe that he ſhoulde not be called the cheefe of prieſts / or the high prieſt / or byſhop of byſhops: nowe I will ſette downe hys office and power whych he had / more then the byſhops.</p>
               <p>In the councell of Antioche it appeareth / that the byſhop of the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane <note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:21261:64"/> ſeate / called Synodes / &amp; propounded the matters whych were to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. &amp;c. the archbyſhop doth not nowe call Synodes / but the Prince dothe / for as much as there is no conuocation wythout a parliament / &amp; he doth not propound the matters / and gather the voyces / but an other choſen / whych is called prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor / therfore in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſpect that an archb. &amp; metropolitane was firſt ordained / we haue no neede of an archb. or metropolitane. Againe / an other cauſe alſo appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth there / whych was to ſee that the byſhoppes kepte them ſelues wythin their owne dioceſes / and brake not into an others dioceſe. But firſt this may be done wythout an archbyſhop / and then it is not done of the archb. (hym ſelfe geuing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences vnto the wandring miniſters to go throughout not ſo few as a doſen dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes) therefore the office of an archb. is not neceſſarye in thys reſpecte / and if it were / yet it muſt be other then it is nowe.</p>
               <p>Againe / the cauſe whye the metropolitane differed from the reſt / and whye <note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> the calling of the Synode was geuen to hym / as it appeareth in the ſame cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel / was for that the greateſt concourſe was to that place / and moſt aſſembly of men / whervnto alſo may be added / for that there was the beſt commodity of lodging &amp; of vitailing / and for that / as it appeareth in other councels / it was the place and ſeate of the Empire. But wyth vs neyther the greateſt concourſe nor aſſemblye of men / nor the greateſt commodity of lodging and vitailing / neyther yet the ſeate of the kingdome is in the metropolitane city / therefore wyth vs there is no ſuche cauſe of a metropolitane or archbyſhop.</p>
               <p>In the councel of Carthage / holden in Cyprians time / it appeareth that no byſhop had authority ouer an other / to compell an other / or to condemne an other / but euery byſhop was left at hys owne liberty to anſwer vnto God / and to make hys accompt vnto Chriſt: and if any thing were done againſt any biſhop / it was done by the conſent of all the byſhops in the prouince / or as many as coulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently aſſemble. Therefore Cyprian / whych was the metropolitane byſhop / had then no authoritye ouer the reſt / and yet then (there being no chriſtian magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate / whych woulde puniſhe the diſorders whych were committed of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian byſhops) there was greateſt neede / that there ſhoulde haue bene ſome one / whych might haue had the correction of the reſt. If therefore when there was moſte neede of thys abſolute authoritie / there neyther was / nor myght be anye ſuche / it followeth that nowe we haue a Chriſtian magiſtrate / whych maye and oughte to puniſhe the diſorders of all Eccleſiaſticall perſons / and may and ought to call them to accoumpt for their faultes / that there ſhoulde be no ſuche neede of an archbyſhop.</p>
               <p>The moderation of their authority in the auncient times may appeare / firſt by a Canon whych is falſly geuen to the apoſtles / being as it is like a Canon of the councell of Antioche / wherin although it ordaineth one primate in euery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">34. canon.</note> ouer the reſt / and will not ſuffer any great matter to be done wythout him / as alſo will not ſuffer him to do any thing wythout the reſt / yet euery B. might do that / whych appertained vnto hys own pariſh / wythout hym / and he nothing to do wyth hym in it. But as it ſeemeth / the meaning of the Canon was / that if there were any waighty matter to be concluded for all the churches in the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / then the byſhops of euery pariſh ſhould not enterpriſe any thing without calling hym to counſell. Now we ſee that the archb. medleth with that whych euery by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop doth in hys owne dioceſe / and hath hys viſitations for that purpoſe / &amp; will take any matter out of their hands / concludeth alſo of diuers matters / neuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the byſhops once priuy to hys doings.</p>
               <p>Higinus / or as ſome thincke Pelagius (I ſpeake heere as Platina repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">Platina cap. Higin.</note> not thincking that in Higinus time / there was any Metropolitane) ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that no Metropolitane ſhould condemne any byſhop / onles the matter were firſt bothe harde and diſcuſſed by the byſhoppes of that prouince / at what time / 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21261:64"/> and after a great while / a biſhop was the ſame we cal a miniſter. Now the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop will wythout any further aſſiſtance or diſcuſſion by others ſuſpend hym / and in the ende alſo throwe him oute of hys charge / and if he haue the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ouer a byſhop / as a byſhop ouer the miniſter (as it is ſayd) he may do the like vnto hym alſo.</p>
               <p>The councell of Antioche ordained / that if the voyces of the byſhops were <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Canon.</hi> 17.</note> euen / and that if halfe did condemne hym / and halfe cleare hym / that then the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitane byſhop ſhoulde call of the nexte prouince ſome other byſhops / whych ſhould make an end of the controuerſy. Wherby appeareth that the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane had ſo ſmall authority and power ouer and aboue the reſt / that he had not ſo much as the caſting voyce / when bothe ſides were euen / and therefore it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth / that beſides the names of metropolitane / there was little or no reſemblance betweene thoſe that were then / and thoſe whych be now.</p>
               <p>Now / to conſider how the byſhops whych are now / differ from the byſhops whych were in times paſt / I muſt call to thy remembrance (gentle reader) that whych I haue ſpoken before / which was that then there was / as appeareth out of Cyprian and Ierome / and others / one byſhop in euery pariſhe or congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nowe one is ouer a thouſande / then euery byſhop had a ſeuerall church where he preached and miniſtred the ſacraments: nowe he hath none / then he ruled that one churche (as I ſhewed oute of Ierome) in common wyth the Elders of the ſame: nowe he ruleth a thouſande by hym ſelfe / ſhutting oute the miniſters / to whome the rule and gouernement belongeth / then he ordained not any miniſter of the churche / except he were firſt choſen by the <hi>presbiterie,</hi> and approued by the people of that place wherevnto he was ordained: nowe he ordaineth where there is no place voyde / and of hys priuate authority / wythout either choiſe or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of preſbyterie or people: then he excommunicated not / nor receiued the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated / but by ſentences of the elderſhip / and conſent of the people / as ſhall appeare afterward: nowe he dothe bothe.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee that contrary to the woorde of God / he hathe gotten into hys owne hande / and pulled to him ſelfe / bothe the preheminence of the other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters / and the liberties of the church / whych God by his word had geuen. And <note place="margin">

               <p>Now if you will alſo conſider how much the Lordſhip / pompe / and ſtateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the byſhops in our dayes / differ from the ſimplicity of them in times paſt / I will geue you alſo a taſte thereof / if firſt of all I ſhewe the beginning / or as it were the fountaine wherevpon the pompe grewe / whych was / when in ſteade of hauing a byſhop in euery pariſhe and congregation / they began to make a biſhop of a whole dioceſe / and of a thouſand congregations.</p>

No doubte thoſe that were authoures of thys / had learned too well our olde prouerb / the fewer the better cheare / but the more byſhops the meryer it had bene wyth Gods people. And they might wyth as good reaſon hinder the ſunne from ſhining in al places / &amp; the raine from falling vpon al grounds / for feare they ſhould not be ſet by / being common / as to bring in ſuch a wicked decree / wherby
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21261:65"/> vnder pretence of deliuering the byſhop from contempt / they ſought nothing elſe but an ambitious and ſtately Lordſhyp ouer thoſe whych had not that title of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that they had / althoughe they did the office of a byſhop better then they dyd. And what intollerable preſumption is thys / to chaunge the inſtitution of God / as though he whych ordained not one only / but ſome nomber more or les of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in euery church / did not ſufficiently foreſee / that the multitude and plentye of byſhops coulde breede no contempt of the office. And it may be as well ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the children of pore men ſhoulde not call them that begate them / fathers and mothers / but only the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the rich / and of noble / leaſt that if euery man that hathe children / ſhoulde be called a father / fathers ſhould be ſette nothyng by. And heere let vs obſerue by what degrees and ſtaires Sathan lifted the childe of perdition vnto that proude title of vniuerſall byſhop. Firſt / where the Lorde did ordaine that there ſhoulde be diuers paſtors / elders / or byſhops in euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation / Sathan wrought firſt that there ſhould be but one in euery churche: thys was no doubt the firſt ſtep. Afterwardes he puſhed further / and ſtirred vp diuers not to content them ſelues to be byſhops of one church / but to deſire to be byſhops of a dioceſe / whervnto although it ſeemeth that there was reſiſtance (in that it is ſayd that it was decreed often) yet in the end this wicked attempt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed / and thys was an other ſtep. Then were there archbiſhops of whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces / whych was the third ſtayer vnto the ſeat of antichriſte. Afterwards they were Patriarks of one of the .iiij. corners of the whole world / the whole church being aſſigned to the iuriſdiction of fower / that is to ſaye of the Romaine / Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitane / Antiochene / and Alexandrine byſhops. And theſe fower ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being layd of Sathan / there was but an eaſy ſtride for the B. of Rome / into that chaire of peſtilence / wherin he nowe ſitteth. Hauing now ſhowed howe thys Lordly eſtate of the byſhop began / and vpon what a rotten ground it is builded / I come to ſhew how farre the byſhops in our time are / for their pompe and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtatelines / degenerated from the byſhops of elder times.</p>
               <p>And heere I call to remembraunce / that whych was ſpoken of the poore eſtate of Baſile and Theodorete: and if M. Doctor will ſay (as he doth in deede in a certaine place) that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was a time of perſecution / and this is a time of peace: it is eaſely anſweared / that although Baſill were vnder perſecution / yet Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorete liued vnder good emperors.

               <p> The byſhops in times paſt had no tayle nor trayne of men after them / and thought it a ſlaunder to the goſpell to haue a number of men before and behynde them. And therefore is <hi>Paulus Sam of atenus</hi> noted as one that brought relygion <note place="margin">

               <p>And as touching Ambroſe houſe / albeit the word doth not employ ſo great gorgeouſnes nor magnificence of an houſe as the palaces and other magnificall buildinges of our byſhoppes: yet the cauſe whereupon thys roſe / doth more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Ambroſe / who being taken from great wealth and gouernment in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth / geuing ouer hys office / dyd retayne hys houſe and that which hee had gotten.</p>

               <p>An other reaſon of thys pompe and ſtatelynes of the byſhoppes was / that which almoſt brought in all poyſon and popiſhe corruption into the church / and that is a fooliſh emulation of the maners and faſhions of the Idolatrous nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

And the chriſtians and chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours / thinking that that would promote the chriſtian relygion that promoted ſuperſtition / and not remembring that it is often times abhomynable before God / which is eſteemed in the eyes of men / endeuoured to make theyr byſhops encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and match with thoſe Idolatrous prieſtes / and to cauſe that they ſhould not <note place="margin">Luke. 16. 15.</note> be inferior to them in wealth and outward pompe. And therfore I conclude that ſeing the cauſes and fountaynes from whence thys pompe and ſtatelynes of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops haue come / are ſo corrupt and naught / the thing it ſelfe which hath ryſen of ſuch cauſes can not be good.</p>
               <p>And thus will I make an end / leauing to the conſideration and indifferent waying of the indifferent reader / how true it is that I haue before propounded / that our Archbyſhops / Metropolitanes / Archdeacons / Byſhops / haue beſides the names almoſt nothing common with thoſe which haue bene in elder tymes / before the ſunne of the goſpell began to be maruellouſly darkned / by the ſtincking miſtes which the deuill ſent forth out of the bottomles pit to blynde the eyes of men / that they ſhoulde not ſee the ſhame and nakednes of that purpled whore / which in the perſon of the cleargy / long before ſhe gat into her ſeate prepared her ſelfe by paynting her wrythen face / with the couloures of theſe gorgeous titles and with the ſhew of magnifycall and worldly pompe. For the deuill knew well enough / that if he ſhould haue ſette vp one only byſhoppe in that ſeate of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / and left all the reſt in that ſimplicitie wherein God had appoynted them / that hys eldeſt ſonne ſhoulde neyther haue had any way to gette into that / and when he had gotten it / yet being as it were an owle amongſt a ſort of birdes / ſhoulde haue bene quickly diſcouered.</p>
               <p>But I haue done / only thys I admoniſhe the reader that I doe not allow of all thoſe thinges which I before alleaged in the compariſon betwene our Archbyſhoppes and the Archbyſhops of olde tyme / or our byſhoppes and theirs. Only my entent is to ſhew that although there were corruptions / yet in reſpect of ours they be much more tollerable: and that it might appeare how ſmale cauſe there is that they ſhould alleage theyr examples to confirme the Archbyſhops and Byſhops that now are.</p>
               <p>Concerning the offices of commiſſionerſhip and how vnmeete it is that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſters of the worde ſhould exerciſe them / and how that the worde of God doth not permitte any ſuch confuſion of offices / there ſhalbe by Gods grace ſpoken of it afterwarde.</p>
               <p>To your anſwere alſo vnto the places of S. Mathew and Luke / the reply is made before. The place of the fourthe of the firſt to the Corinthyans / is well
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21261:66"/> alledged / for it teacheth a moderate eſtymation of the myniſters / and a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the contempt and exceſſiue eſtymation / neyther can there be any redyer way to breede that diſorder which was amongſt the Corinthyans / as to ſay I holde of ſuch a one / and I of ſuch a one / and I of ſuch an other / then to ſette vp cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne myniſters in ſo hyghe Titles and great ſhew of worldly honoure. For ſo commeth it to paſſe / that the people will ſaye / I beleeue my Lord / and my Lord archbyſhoppe / whatſoeuer oure parſon ſay / for they bee wyſe men and learned / as wee ſee it came to paſſe amongſt the Corrinthyans. For the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hadde a ſhewe and outwarde pompe of ſpeache / they caryed away the people. For althoughe Saynt Paule ſayeth that ſome ſayde / I holde of <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 6.</note> Paule / I holde of Apollo / I of Cephas / yet as it appeareth in an other place / they helde one of thys braue eloquent teacher / an other of that. For hee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated theſe ſpeaches vnto hym and hys fellowes by a fygure. All that rule is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannycall / whiche is not lawfull / and is more then it oughte to bee / and therfore the place of Saynt Peter is fitly alleaged / whereof alſo I haue ſpoken ſome thing before.</p>
               <p>You are you ſay of Hemingius mynde / and thincke that thys opynion ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of Anabaptiſme / I haue ſhewed how you haue depraued and corrupted He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingius / and deſire you to ſhew ſome better reaſon of your opynion / <hi>autos ephe,</hi> will not ſuffice vs. You ſay / that if we had once obtayned equalitie amongſt the cleargie / we would attempt it in the laitie.</p>
               <p>In what ſtarre doe you ſee that Maiſter Doctor? Moyſes ſayth / that if a <note place="margin">Deut. 18. 22.</note> man ſpeake of a thing to come / and it come not to paſſe as he hath ſpoken / that that man is a falſe Prophet / if your propheſie come not to paſſe / you know your iudgement already out of Moyſes.</p>
               <p>The Phariſies when our ſauiour Chriſt inueighed agaynſt their ambyti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / accuſed hym that he was no freende to Ceſar / and went about to diſcredite <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 2.</note> hym with the cyuill Magiſtrate / you ſhall apply it your ſelfe / you will needes make the Archbyſhoppe. &amp;c. neyghboures vnto the cyuill Magiſtrates / and yet they almoſt dwell as farre a ſonder as Rome and Ieruſalem / and as Syon and S. Peters Church there / ſo that the houſe of the archbyſhoppe may bee burnt ſticke and ſtone / when not ſo much as the ſmoke ſhall approche the houſe of the cyuill magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>In the. 116. page / for the authoritie of the archbyſhoppe / is alleaged the nynthe Canon of the Councell of Antioch / which I haue before alleaged / to proue how farre different the authoritie of the Metropolitane in thoſe times was from that which is now. For there the Councell ſheweth that euery Byſhoppe in hys Dioceſe / hath the ordering of all matters within the circuite thereof / and therfore the meaning of the Councell to bee / that if there be any affaires that touche the whole Churche many lande / that the Byſhoppes ſhoulde doe nothing without making the Metropolitane priuy / as alſo the Metropolitane myght doe nothing without making the other Byſhops a counſell of that which he attempted / which maiſter Doctor doth cleane leaue out.</p>
               <p>And if thys authoritie which the councell geueth to the Metropolitane / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing ſo exceſſiue as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authorytie of our Metropolitanes now / had not bene ouer much / or had bene iuſtifiable / what needed men father thys Canon (which was ordayned in thys councell) of the Apoſtles / for the ſeeking falſly of the name of the Apoſtles / to geue creadite vnto thys Canon / doth cary with it a note of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and of ſhame / which they woulde haue couered as it were with the garment of the Apoſtles authoritie.</p>
               <p>And in the hundreth twentie and three page / to that which Maiſter Bucer ſayeth / that in the Churches there hath bene one which hath beene cheefe ouer the reſt of the myniſters / if he meane one cheefe in euery particulare churche / or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21261:67"/> one cheefe ouer the myniſters of dyuers churches meeting at one Synode / and cheefe for the time / and for ſuch reſpectes as I haue before ſhewed / then I am of that mynde which he is: And if he meane any other cheefe / or after any other ſort / I deny that any ſuch cheefety was from the Apoſtles tymes / or that any ſuche cheefetie pleaſeth the holye ghoſte / whereof I haue before ſhewed the proufes.</p>
               <p>And wheras M. Bucer ſeemeth to allow / that the name of a byſhop / which the holy ghoſt expreſly geueth to all the miniſters of the word indifferently / was appropriated to certen cheefe gouernoures of the church / I haue before ſhewed by dyuers reaſons / how that was not done without great preſumption and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt daunger / and in the end great hurt to the church.</p>
               <p>And if M. Doctor delyght thus to oppoſe mens authoritie to the authoritie of the holy ghoſt / and to the reaſons which are grounded out of the ſcripture / M. Caluin doth openly miſſelyke of the making of that name proper and peculiar to certayne / which the holy ghoſt maketh common to moe. And whereas of M. Caluines wordes / which ſayth that there be degrees of honor in the myniſtery / M. Doctor would gather an archbyſhop / if he had vnderſtanded that an Apoſtle is aboue an Euangeliſt / an Euangeliſt aboue a paſtor / a paſtor aboue a doctor / and he aboue an elder that ruleth only / he needed neuer to haue gone to the popiſh Hierarchie / to ſeeke hys dyuerſities of degrees / which he myght haue founde in S. Paule. And whereas vpon M. Caluines words / which ſayeth that Paule was one of the cheefe amongſt the Apoſtles / he would ſeeme to conclude an arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop amongſt the byſhops / he ſhould haue remembred / that S. Paules cheef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie amongſt the Apoſtles / conſiſted not in hauing any authoritie or domynion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the reſt / but in labouring and ſuffering more then the reſt / and in giftes more excellent then the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now where as hee ſayeth / that we deſire to pull the rule from others / that the rule myght be in oure handes / and we myght doe what we liſt / and that we ſeeke to wythdraw oure ſelues from controlement of Prince / and Byſhoppe / and all. Firſte / hee may learne if hee will / that wee deſire no other authoritie then that / which is to the edifying of the church / and which is grounded of the word of God: which if any myniſter ſhall abuſe to hys gayne or ambytion / then he ought to abyde not only the controlement of the other myniſters / yea of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren / but alſo further the puniſhment of the Magiſtrates according to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the faulte.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing you charge the brethren ſo ſore / you muſt be put in remembrance / that thys vnreaſonable authoritie ouer the reſt of the myniſters and clergy / came to the byſhops and archbyſhops / when as the Pope dyd exempt hys ſhauelinges from the obedience / ſubiection / and iuriſdiction of the Princes: now therfore that we be ready to geue that ſubiection vnto the Prince / and offer our ſelues to the Princes correction in things wherein we ſhall doe a miſſe / doe you thincke it an vnreaſonable thing / that we deſire to bee diſburdened of the byſhops and archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops yoke / which the Pope hath layde vpon our neckes?</p>
               <p>And in the. 207. page vnto the middeſt of the 214. page / thys matter is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne handled / where firſt M. Doctor would draw the place of Galathians the ſecond / to proue an archbyſhop / and that by a falſe tranſlation / for <hi>hoi dokountes</hi> / which is (they that ſeemed or appeared) he hath tranſlated (they y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are the cheefe) &amp; although the place of the Galathians may be thought of ſome not ſo pregnant / nor ſo full agaynſt the archbyſhop / yet all muſt needes confeſſe / that it maketh more againſt him then for him. For S. Paules purpoſe is to proue there / that he was not inferioure to any of the Apoſtles / &amp; bringeth one argument thereof / that he had not his goſpel from them / but from Chriſt immediatly / &amp; therfore if the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles that were eſtemed moſt of / and ſuppoſed by the Galathians &amp; others to be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21261:67"/> the cheefe / had no ſuperioritie ouer S. Paule / but were equall wyth hym / it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that there was none that had rule ouer the reſt. And if there needed no one of the Apoſtles to be ruler ouer the reſt / there ſeemeth to be no neede / that one byſhoppe ſhould rule ouer the reſt. But that I run not backe to that I haue handled before / I will not heere ſo much vrge the place / as I will not doe alſo that of the Hebrues which followeth / and yet the argument is ſtronger / then that M. Doctor coulde anſwere. For if the wryter to the Hebrues / doe proue our ſauiour Chriſtes vocation to be iuſt and lawfull / becauſe hys calling was contayned in the ſcriptures / as appeareth in the 5. and 6. verſe / then it followeth that the calling of the archbiſhop which is not comprehended there / is neither iuſt nor lawfull. For that no man (ſayth the apoſtle) taketh that honour vnto hym ſelfe / but he that is called of God. &amp;c. But I ſay / hauing before ſufficiently ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the reaſons which ouerthrow the archbyſhoppe / I will let paſſe theſe and other places / anſwearing only that which M. Doctor bringeth for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. He ſayth therefore afterwarde / that although one man be not able to be byſhop ouer all the church / yet he may be byſhop ouer a whole dioceſe / or of a prouince. Now if I wold ſay the one is as impoſſible as the other / &amp; for proofe thereof alleage that which the Philoſophers ſay / that as there are no degrees in that which is infinite / ſo that of thinges which are infinite / one thing can not be more infinite then an other / ſo there are no degrees in impoſſibilitie / that of thinges which are impoſſible / one thyng ſhoulde bee more impoſſible then an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: If I ſhoulde thus reaſon / I thincke I ſhoulde putte you to ſome payne. But I will not draw the reader to ſuche thorney and ſubtile queſtyons / it is enough for vs / that the one and the other be impoſſible / although one ſhoulde bee more impoſſible then the other. And that it is impoſſible for one man to bee by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe ouer a whole prouince / or ouer a whole dyoceſe / I leaue it to bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of that which is before ſayde in the diſcription of the office of a byſhoppe / paſtor / or miniſter / where I ſpeake of the neceſſitie of the reſidence of the byſhop in hys church.</p>
               <p>As a Prince may rule a whole realme / ſuch as Fraunce / or Englande / ſo may he rule the whole world by officers and magiſtrates appoynted vnderneath hym: And there haue bene dyuers Princes / which haue had as many landes vnder their power / as the Pope hath had churches / and although it be ſomewhat inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient / yet I know not why they might not ſo haue / comming lawfully by them. Now I woulde gladly heare whether you woulde ſay the ſame of a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe / and if you dare not / then why doe you bring the ſimilitude of the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Prince ouer a lande / to proue that an archbyſhop may be ouer a whole prouince. M. Doctor dare boldly ſay / that there may be one byſhop ouer a whole prouince / but he dare not ſay that there may be a byſhop ouer the whole Church. But what better warrant for the one / then for the other? Agayne / if the whole church be in one prouince or in one realme / which hath bene / and is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be agayne / if there may be now one byſhop ouer a realme or prouince / then there may be one byſhop ouer all the church / ſo that in trauayling with an arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop / he hath brought forth a Pope.</p>
               <p>But he ſayth that an archbyſhop hath not the charge of gouernment ouer the whole prouince generally / but in caſes exempted / &amp; ſo may doe it more eaſely: But he ſhould haue remembred / that he aſſigned before the offices of archbyſhop &amp; byſhop / to be in all thoſe things / which other miniſters are / &amp; that beſides thoſe offices / he geueth them particulare charges. So that where the office of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is but to preach / pray / &amp; miniſter the ſacraments in hys pariſh / the office of archbyſhop &amp; biſhop / is to do the ſame / and more in the whole prounice or dioceſe. And ſo it followeth that it is eaſyer for a miniſter to diſcharge his duetie in hys pariſh / then for an archbyſhop or byſhop to diſcharge their dueties in any one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21261:68"/> of their prouince or dioceſe. For they haue in euery pariſh more to doe / and greater charge / then the myniſter of the paryſhe hath / then much leſſe are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe their dueties in all the paryſhes of theyr prouinces or dyoceſe.</p>
               <p>After M. Doctor tranſlateth out of M. Caluin / the papiſtes reaſons for the ſupremacy of the Pope / and M. Caluines ſolutions. For what purpoſe hee knoweth / I can not tell / vnles it be to blot paper / I know not what he ſhoulde meane / and the quarell alſo which he picketh / to tranſlate thys place / is yet more ſtrange. For he ſayth that the authors of the admonition / borowed their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes from the papiſtes / when the contrary is true / that they vſe the reaſons which they of the goſpell vſe agaynſt the ſupremacy of the pope / to ouerthrow the archbyſhoppe. And maiſter Doctor doth vſe reaſons to defende the archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop / which the papiſtes vſe to mayntayne the Pope. For M. Doctor woulde proue / that for becauſe there is one king ouer a realme / therefore there may be one byſhop ouer a prouince / and the papiſtes vſe the ſame reaſon to proue the Pope to be a byſhop of the whole church. Shew now one reaſon / that the authors of the admonition brought of the papiſtes / to proue that there ſhould be no archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. But now I perceiue hys meaning / and that is / that he thought to gette ſome comfort for the archbiſhop in M. Caluins ſolutions made vnto the papiſtes reaſons for the ſupremacy: and therfore he hath haled and pulled in as it were by the ſhulders / thys diſputation betwene the proteſtants and the papiſtes touching the ſupremacy. And what is it that M. Caluin ſayth for the archbyſhop? It hath bene before ſhewed / what his iudgement was touching hauing one myniſter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the myniſters of a prouince / and that he doth ſimply condemne it in hys commentary vpon the firſt chap. of the Phillippians. Now let it be conſidered / whether in theſe ſentences he hath ſayd any thing againſt hym ſelfe. The papiſtes obiect that for ſo much as there was one high prieſt in Iury ouer all the church / therfore there ſhould be one byſhop ouer all. To whom M. Caluin anſweareth / that the reaſon followeth not: for ſayth he / there is no reaſon to extend that to all the world / which was profitable in one nation. Heereupon M. Doctor would conclude that M. Caluine allowath one archbyſhop ouer a whole prouince.</p>
               <p>If one going about to proue that he may haue as many wiues as hee liſt / woulde alledge Iacob for an Example which had two wyues: and Maiſter Doctor ſhould anſwere and ſay / that although hee myght haue two wyues / yet it followeth not that he may haue as many as he liſt / would not Maiſter Doctor thinke that he had great iniurye / if a man ſhould conclude of theſe wordes / that hys opynion is that a man may haue two wyues? I thinke that he would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he had great wrong / and yet thus would he conclude of Maiſter Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines wordes in thys firſt ſentence / whereas in deede M. Caluine declareth a little after / a ſpeciall reaſon why there was but one high prieſt in the whole land of Iury / which is becauſe he was a figure of Chriſt / and that therby ſhuld be ſhadowed out hys ſole meditation betwene God &amp; his church. And therefore ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forſomuch as there is none to repreſent or figure our ſauiour Chriſt / that his iudgement is / that as there ſhoulde be no one ouer all the churches / ſo ſhould there be no one ouer any nation. To the papiſtes obiecting for the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy / that S. Peter was the prince &amp; cheefe of the apoſtles / M. Caluin anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth / firſt by denying that Peter was ſo / and bringeth many places to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was equall to the other apoſtles. Afterward he ſayth / although it be graunted / that Peter was cheefe / yet followeth it not becauſe one may beare rule ouer twelue being but a few in number / that therefore one may rule ouer an hundreth thouſand / &amp; that it followeth not / that that which is good amongſt a few / is forth with good in all the world. Now let all men iudge / with what conſcience &amp; truſt / M. Doct. cyteth M. Caluin / for to proue the office of the archbyſhop. But I maruell that he could not alſo ſee that / which M. Caluin wryteth in the next ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21261:68"/> almoſt / where he ſayth that Chriſt is only the head of the church / and that the church doth cleaue one to an other vnder his domynion: but by what meanes? according (ſayth he) to the order and forme of pollicy which he hath preſcribed / but he hath preſcribed no ſuch forme of pollicy / that one byſhop ſhould be ouer all the myniſters and churches in a whole dioceſe / or one archbyſhop ouer all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and churches in a whole prouince / therefore thys forme of pollicy which is by archbyſhops / and ſuch byſhops as we haue / is not the meanes to knitte vs one to an other in vnitie vnder the domynion of Chriſt. Touching the titles and names of honor which are geuen to the Eccleſiaſticall perſones with vs / and how that princes and cyuill magiſtrates may and ought to haue the title / which can not be geuen to the myniſters / I haue ſpoken before / and therefore of archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops / archdeacons / and the lord byſhops thus farre.</p>

               <p>BEfore I come to ſpeake of prayers / I will treate of the faults that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted almoſt thrughout the whole Leyturgy / &amp; publike ſeruice of the church of England. Whereof one is that / which is often obiected by the authors of the admonition / that the forme of it / is taken from the church of Antichriſt / as the reading of the Epiſtles and Goſpels ſo cutte &amp; mangled / as the moſt of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers / the maner of myniſtring the Sacraments / of Mariage / of Buriall / Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation / tranſlated as it were word for word / ſauing that the groſſe erroures and manifeſt impieties be taken away. For although the formes &amp; ceremonies which they vſed / were not vnlawfull / and that they contayned nothing which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the word of God (which I would they dyd not) yet notwithſtanding / neyther the worde of God / nor reaſon / nor the examples of the eldeſt churches both Iewiſhe and chriſtian / doe permitte vs to vſe the ſame formes and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies / being neyther commaunded of God / neyther ſuch / as there may not as good as they / and rather better be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>For the word of God I haue ſhewed before / both by the example of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles conforming the Gentiles vnto the Iewes in their ceremonies / &amp; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the Iewes to the Gentiles / &amp; by that the wiſedom of God hath thought <note place="margin">Act. 15. 20.</note> it a good way to keepe hys people from the infection of idolatry and ſuperſtition / to ſeuere them from idolaters by outwarde ceremonies / and therefore hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them to do things which are in them ſelues very lawfull to be done. <note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 27.

               </p>
               <p>Now I will adde thys further / that when as the Lord was carefull to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere them by ceremonies from other nations / yet was he not ſo carefull to ſeuere them from any / as from the * Egiptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s amongſt whom they liued / &amp; from thoſe nations which were next neighbors vnto them / becauſe from them was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt feare of infection.

Philoſophie which is nothing elſe but reaſon / teacheth / that if a man will draw one from vice which is an extreeme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vertue / which is the meane / that it is the beſt way to bring hym as far from that vice as may be / and that it is ſafer and leſſe harme for him to be led ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too farre / then he ſhuld be ſuffered to remayne within the borders and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of that vice wherewith he is infected. As if a man would bring a droncken man to ſobrietie / the beſt and neareſt way is to cary hym as farre from hys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in druicke as may be / and if a man could not keepe a meane / it were better to fault in preſcribing leſſe then he ſhoulde drincke / then to faulte in geuing hym more then he ought.

It is true / that the diuerſity of ceremonies ought not to cauſe the churches to diſſent one wyth an other / but yet it maketh much to the auoyding of diſſention / that there be amongſt them an vnity / not only in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine / but alſo in Ceremonies. Nowe we ſee plainely / that as the forme of oure ſeruice and Leyturgie commeth to neare that of the papiſtes / ſo it is farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of other churches reformed / and therfore in bothe theſe reſpectes to be amended.</p>
               <p>An other faulte there is in the whole ſeruice or Lyturgie of Englande / for that it maintaineth an vnpreaching miniſtery / and ſo conſequently an vnlawfull miniſtery. I ſay it maintaineth / not ſo muche in that it appoynteth a number of pſalmes and other prayers and chapters to be red / whych may occupye the time whych is to be ſpent in preaching / wherin notwythſtanding it ought to haue bene more wary / conſidering that the deuil vnder this coloure of long prayer / did thus in the kingdome of antichriſte baniſh preaching / I ſay not ſo much in that poynt / as for that it requireth neceſſarily nothyng to be done by the miniſter / whych a childe of ten yeare olde can not doe / as well and as lawfully / as that man where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth the boke contenteth it ſelfe. Neyther can it be ſhifted / in ſaying this is done for want of able men to be miniſters / for it may be eaſely anſweared / that firſt the want of ſufficient miniſters ought to be no cauſe for men to breake the vncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lawes of God / whych be / that none maye be made miniſter of the churche / whych can not teache / that none miniſter the ſacraments whych do not preache. For althoughe it might be graunted / (whych thing I woulde not denye / no not when there are enough ſufficient miniſters / ) that they may appoynt ſome godly graue man whych can do nothing elſe but reade to be a reader in the churche / yet that may not be graunted / that they maye make of one that can doe nothyng but reade / a miniſter of the goſpell / or one whych may haue power to miniſter the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes.</p>
               <p>Beſides that / howe can they ſay that it is for want of ſufficient miniſters / when as there be put out of the miniſterye men that be able to ſerue God in that calling / and thoſe put in their roumes / whych are not able / when there are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers alſo whych are fit to ſerue and neuer ſought for / nor once required to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miniſtery vpon them? If therfore it were lawfull to plead want of able mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters / for this dumbe miniſtery whych is altogither vnlawfull / yet woulde thys plea neuer be good / vntill ſuche time as bothe thoſe were reſtored whych are put out / and all other ſought forth and called vpon whych are fit for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Againe / it can not be ſayde iuſtly / that they haue taken theſe reading mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21261:70"/>
/ vntill ſuche time as better may be gotten / for if the church could procure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miniſters / and ſhould deſire that they mighte be ordained ouer them / they can not obtaine that / conſidering that theſe reading miniſters haue a free hold / and an eſtate for terme of their liues in thoſe churches / of the whych they are ſuch mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: ſo that by thys meanes / the ſheepe are not only committed to an idoll ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard / I might ſay a wolfe / and ſpeake no otherwiſe then Aug. ſpeaketh / in that a not preaching miniſter hath entrance into the church / but the dore alſo is ſhutte vpon him / and ſparred againſt any able miniſter / that might haply be found oute.</p>
               <p>There is a third fault / whych likewiſe appeareth almoſt in the whole body of this ſeruice and Liturgie of England / and that is that the profit whych might haue come by it vnto the people / is not reaped. Whereof the cauſe is / for that he whych readeth / is not in ſome places heard / and in the moſt places not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the people / through the diſtance of place betweene the people and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter / ſo that a great part of the people can not of knowledge tell / whether he hathe curſſed them or bleſſed them / whether he hath red in Latine or in Engliſh / all the whych riſeth vpon the words of the boke of ſeruice / whych are that the miniſter ſhould ſtand in the accuſtomed place. For therevpon the miniſter in ſaying mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening prayer / ſitteth in the chauncell / wyth hys backe to the people / as thoughe he had ſome ſecreate talke wyth God / whych the people myghte not heare. And herevpon it is likewiſe / that after morning prayer for ſaying a nother number of prayers / he climeth vp to the further end of the chauncel / and runneth as farre from the people / as the wall wil let him / as though there were ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance betwene the people and the miniſter / or as though he were afraide of ſome infection of plage. And in dede it renueth the memory of the Leuitical prieſthode / whych did withdrawe himſelfe from the people into the place called the holyeſt place / where he talked wyth God / and offered for the ſinnes of the people.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe for Mariage he cometh backe againe into the body of the church / and for baptiſme vnto the church dore / what comelines / what decency / what edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying is thys? Decencie (I ſay) in running and trudging from place to place / e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying: in ſtanding in that place / and after that ſort / where he can worſt be harde and vnderſtanded. S. Luke ſheweth / that in the primitiue church both the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <note place="margin">Actes. 1. 15.</note> and preachings / and the whole exerciſe of religion was done otherwyſe. For he ſheweth howe S. Peter ſitting amongſte the reſt / to the ende he myght be the better heard / roſe / &amp; not that only / but that he ſtode in the midſt of the people / that his voyce might as much as might be / come indifferently to all their eares / and ſo ſtanding / both prayed and preached. Now if it be ſaid for the chapters &amp; Letany / there is commaundement geuen / that they ſhuld be red in the body of the church / in deede it is true / and therof is eaſely perceiued this diſorder whych is in ſaying the reſt of the prayers / partly in the hither end / and partly in the further end of the chauncell. For ſeeing that thoſe are red in the body of the church / that the people may both heare and vnderſtand what is red / what ſhuld be the cauſe why the reſt ſhould be red farther of / vnles it be / that either thoſe things are not to be heard of them / or at the leaſt not ſo neceſſary for them to be heard as the other whych are recited in the body or midſt of the church. And if it be further ſayd / that the boke leaueth that to the diſcretion of the ordinarye / and that he may reforme it if there be any thing amis / then it is eaſely anſwered again / that beſides that it is againſt reaſon / that the commoditye and edifying of the church ſhould depende vpon the pleaſure of one man / ſo that vpon hys eyther good or euill aduiſe and diſcretion / it ſhould be well or euell wyth the church: Beſides this (I ſay) we ſee by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the diſorders whych are in many churches and dioceſes in thys behalfe / how that if it were lawfull to commit ſuch authority vnto one man / yet that it is not ſafe ſo to doe / conſidering that they haue ſo euill quitten them ſelues in their charges / and that in a matter / the inconuenience wherof being ſo eaſely ſene / and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21261:70"/> ſo eaſely reformed / there is notwythſtanding ſo greate and ſo generall an abuſe. And the end of the order in the boke is to be obſerued / which is to kepe the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the accuſtomed place of the church / chappell / or chauncell / whych how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to edification? And thus for the generall faultes committed either in the whole Liturgy / or in the moſt part of it / both that I may haue no nede to repete the ſame in the particulares / and that I be not compelled alwayes to enter a new diſputation / ſo ofte as M. Doctor ſayeth very vnſkilfully / and vnlike a deuine / whence ſo euer thys or that come / ſo it be not euill / it may be well eſtabliſhed in the church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Nowe I come to the forme of prayer whych is preſcribed / wherin the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the admonition declare / that their meaning is not to diſalow of preſcript ſeruice of prayer / but of thys forme that we haue. For they expound themſelues in the additions vnto the firſt part of the admonition. It is not to any purpoſe / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> M. Doctor ſetteth himſelfe to proue / that there may be a preſcript order of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by Iuſtine Martyrs teſtimony / which notwithſtanding hath not one word of preſcript forme of prayers / only he ſayth there were prayers. He ſayth in dede the auncient fathers ſay that there hathe bene alwayes ſuch kinde of prayers in the churches / &amp; although they do ſay ſo / yet all men may vnderſtand eaſely / that M. doctor ſpeaketh thys rather by coniecture / or that he hath heard other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay ſo: for ſo much as that Doctor whych he hathe choſen out to ſpeake for all the reſt / hath no ſuch thing / as he fathereth on him. He ſayeth that after they haue bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed / they pray for them ſelues / &amp; for hym that is baptiſed / and for all men that they may be mete to learne the truth / and to expres it in their honeſt conuerſation / and that they be found to kepe the commaundements / that they may attaine to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life / but is this to ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there was a preſcript forme of prayer / when he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing els but the chefe poynts vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whych they conceiued their prayers? If you had alleaged thys to proue what were the matters or principall poyntes that the primitiue church vſed to pray for / you had alleaged thys to purpoſe / but to alleage it for a profe of a preſcript forme of prayer / when there is not there me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſo much as the eſſentiall forme of prayer (whych is the aſking of our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the name / and through the interceſſion of our ſauior Chriſt) without the whych there is not / nor cannot be any prayer / argueth that either you litle know what the forme of prayer is / or that you thought (as you charge the authors of the admonition ſo often) that this geare of yours ſhould neuer haue come to the examination. But for as muche as we agree of a preſcript forme of prayer to be vſed in the church let that go: thys that I haue ſayd / is to ſhew that when M. Doctor hapneth of a good cauſe / whych is very ſeldome in this boke / yet then he marreth it in the handling. After he affirmeth / that there can be nothing ſhewed in the whole boke / whych is not agreeable vnto the word of God.</p>
               <p>I am very lothe to enter into this field / albeit M. Doctor dothe thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke me / bothe becauſe the Papiſtes will lightly take occaſion of euill ſpeaking / when they vnderſtand that we do not agree amongſt our ſelues in euery poynte / as for that ſome fewe profeſſors of the goſpell being priuate men / boldened vpon ſuch treatiſes / take ſuch wayes ſometimes / and breake forth into ſuch ſpeaches / as are not meete nor conuenient.</p>
               <p>Notwythſtanding my duetie of defending the truthe / and loue whych I haue firſt towardes God / and then towards my countrey / conſtraineth me being thus prouoked / to ſpeake a fewe woordes more particularly of the fourme of prayer / that when the blemiſhes thereof doe appeare / it may pleaſe the Queenes maieſtie / and her honourable Councell / wyth thoſe of the Parliamente / whome the Lorde hathe vſed as ſingulare inſtrumentes to deliuer thys realme from the hotte furnaice and iron yoke of the popiſhe Egipte / to procure alſo / that the corruptions whych we haue broughte from them (as thoſe wyſh whych we
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21261:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> being ſo deepely dide and ſtained / haue not ſo eaſely ſhaken of) may be remoued from amongſt vs / to the end that we being nearelyer both ioyned vnto the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the goſpell / and the pollicy of other reformed churches / may therby be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nearer wyth the Lord / and may be ſet ſo far from Rome / that both we may comfort our ſelues in the hope / that we ſhall neuer returne thether againe / &amp; our aduerſaries whych deſire it / and by this too much agreement with them / and too little wyth the reformed churches / hope for it / may not only be deceiued of their expectation / but alſo being out of all hope of that whych they deſire / may the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner yeelde themſelues vnto the truth / whervnto they are now diſobedient.</p>
               <p>And as for the papiſtes triumphe in thys caſe / I ſhall not greatly neede to feare it / conſidering that their diſcords and contentions are greater / and that our ſtrife is / becauſe we would be farther from them. For the other that profes the goſpell / I will deſire in the name of God / that they abuſe not my labor to other end / then I beſtowe it / and that they keepe them ſelues in their callings / commit the matter by prayer vnto the Lord / leauing to the miniſters of the word of god / and to the magiſtrates that / whych appertaineth vnto them.</p>
               <p>To come therfore to touch thys matter / I anſwer that there is fault in the <note place="margin">The collect of Trinitye ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</note> matter / and fault in the fourme. In the matter / for that there are things there / that ought not to be / and thyngs there are wanting in the order that ſhuld be. Of the firſt ſort is / that we may euermore be defended from all aduerſity.</p>
               <p>Now / for as much as there is no promiſe in the ſcripture / that we ſhould be free from all aduerſity / and that euermore / it ſemeth that this prayer might haue bene better conceiued / being no prayer of faith / or of the whych we can aſſure our ſelues that we ſhall obtaine it. For if it be ſayd that by the worde (aduerſity) is meant all euill / we know that it hath no ſuch ſignification / neither in this tongue of oures / neyther in other tongues whych vſe the ſame worde in common wyth vs / but that it ſignifieth trouble / vexation / and calamitye / from all the whych we may not deſire alwayes to be deliuered. And whatſoeuer can be alledged for the defence of it / yet euery one that is not contentious / may ſee that it needeth ſome caution or exception.</p>
               <p>In the collect vpon the twelfth ſonday after Trinitie ſonday / and likewiſe in one of thoſe whych are to be ſayd after the Offertorie (as it is termed) is done / requeſt is made / that God would geue thoſe thyngs whych we for oure vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes dare not aſke / whych carieth wyth it ſtill the note of the popiſhe ſeruile feare / and ſauoureth not of that confidence and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t familiaritie / that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God haue thorough Chriſt / wyth their heauenly father. For as we dare not wythout our ſauioure Chriſt aſke ſo much as a crumme of bread / ſo there is nothing whych in hys name we dare not aſke / being needefull for vs / and if it be not needefull / why ſhould we aſke it? And if all the prayers were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / and referred to theſe two heades of Gods glory / and of the thyngs whych pertaine to this preſent life / I can make no Geometricall and exact meaſure / but verely I beleue / there ſhalbe found more then a third part of the prayers whych are not pſalmes and texts of ſcriptures / ſpent in praying for / and praying againſt the commodities / and incommodities of this life / whych is contrary to all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments or contents of the prayers of the churche / whych are ſette downe in the ſcripture / and eſpecially of our ſauior Chriſtes prayer / by the whych ours ought to be directed / which of .vij. petitions / beſtoweth one only that wayes. And this / theſe foreſayd prayers do / not only in generall words / but by deducting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and incommodities of thys life into their particulare kindes / &amp; we pray for the auoiding of thoſe dangers which are nothyng neare vs / as from lightning and thundering in the midſt of winter / from ſtorme and tempeſt / when the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is moſt faire / and the ſeas moſt calme. &amp;c. It is true / that vpon ſome vrgent calamity / a prayer may and ought to be framed / whych may beg eyther the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21261:71"/> for want whereof the Church is in diſtres / or the turning away of that miſcheefe whych eyther approcheth / or whych is alreadye vppon it: but to make thoſe prayers whych are for the preſent time and daunger / ordinarye and dailye prayers / I can not hetherto ſee any / either ſcripture or example of the primitiue churche. And heere for the ſimples ſake I will ſet downe after what ſorte thys abuſe crept into the church.</p>
               <p>There was one Mamercus biſhop of Vienna / whych in the time of great <note place="margin">Platina cap. Leo.</note> earthquakes whych were in Fraunce / inſtituted certaine ſupplications / whych the Grecians / &amp; we of them call the Letany / whych concerned that matter: there is no doubte but as other diſcommodities roſe in other countreys / they likewiſe had prayers accordingly. Nowe Pope Gregorie eyther made himſelfe / or gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſupplications that were made againſte the calamities of euery countrey / and made of them a great Letany or ſupplication / as Platina calleth it / and gaue it to be vſed in all churches: whych thing albeit all churches might do for the time in reſpect of the caſe of the caſamity whych the churches ſuffered / yet there is no cauſe why it ſhould be perpetuall / that was ordained but for a time / and why all landes ſhould pray to be deliuered from the incommodities / that ſome land hathe bene troubled wyth.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſayd of the <hi>gloria patri,</hi> and the Athanaſius Crede: it was firſt brought into the churche / to the ende that: nen thereby ſhould make an open profeſſion in the church of the diuinitie of the ſonne of God / againſt the deteſtable opinion of Arius and his diſciples / wherwith at that time maruellouſly ſwarmed almoſt the whole chriſtendome / now that it hath pleaſed the Lord to quench that fire / there is no ſuch cauſe whye theſe things ſhould be in the church / at the leaſt why that <hi>gloria patri,</hi> ſhould be ſo often repeated.</p>
               <p>Moreouer / to make <hi>Benedictus, Magnificat,</hi> and <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> ordinarye and daily prayers / ſeemeth to be a thing not ſo conuenient / conſidering that they do no more concerne vs / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all other ſcriptures do / and then doth the <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> as they called it. For although they were prayers of thanks geuing in Simeon / <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>acharie / and the bleſſed virgin Mary / yet can they not be ſo in vs / whych haue not receiued lyke benefites / they may be added to the number of Pſalmes / and ſo ſong as they be / but to make daily and ordinary prayers of them / is not wythout ſome inconuenience and diſorder.</p>
               <p>And ſo haue I anſweared vnto thoſe thyngs whych are contained in the 202. 203. pages / ſauing that I muſt admoniſh the reader / that wheras you will proue that we ought to haue an ordinarye prayer to be deliuered from danger of thunder / lightnings. &amp;c. becauſe there are examples of certen that haue bene kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereby / you mighte as well bryng in a prayer / that men may not haue falles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their horſes / may not fal into the hands of robbers / may not fall into waters / and a number ſuch more ſodaine deathes / wherwith a greater number are taken away / then by thundrings or lightnings / and ſuch like / and ſo there ſhould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any end of begging theſe earthly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modityes / whych is contrary to the forme of prayer / appoynted by our ſauioure Chriſte.</p>
               <p>And wheras you alledge the petition of the Lords prayer (deliuer vs from euill) to proue this prayer againſt Thunder. &amp;c. beſides that all the commodities and diſcommodities of thys life are prayed for / and prayed againſt in that petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / whereby we deſire oure daily breade: it is very ſtraunge to apply that to the thunder / that is vnderſtanded of the deuill / as the article <hi>apo tou ponerou</hi> dothe declare.

               <p>As theſe are diuers things more then ought to be conueniently / ſo wante there ſome things in the prayers. There are prayers ſet forthe to be ſayde in the common calamities / and vniuerſal ſcourges of the realme / as plague / famine. &amp;c. and in dede ſo it ought to be by the word of God ioyned wyth a publike faſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded / not only when we are in any calamity / but alſo when any the churches round about vs / or in any countrey receiue any generall plague or greeuous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement at the Lordes hand. But as ſuche prayers are needefull / whereby we beg releaſe from our diſtreſſes / ſo there ought to be as neceſſary prayers of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks geuing / whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue receiued thoſe things at the Lords hand / whych we aſked in our prayers. And thus much touching the matter of the prayers / eyther not altogither ſound / or elſe too much or too little.</p>
               <p>Concerning the fourme / there is alſo to be miſliked: A great cauſe wherof is the folowing of the forme vſed in Popery / againſt whych I haue before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For whileſt that ſeruice was ſet in many poynts as a paterne of this / it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to pas / that in ſtead of ſuche prayers as the primitiue churches haue vſed / &amp; thoſe that be reformed / now vſe / we haue diuers ſhort cuts &amp; ſhreddings / whych may be better called wiſhes then prayers. And that no man thinke that thys is ſome idle fancie / &amp; that it is no matter of weight / what forme of prayer we vſe / ſo that the prayers be good / it muſt be vnderſtanded / that as it is not ſufficient to preach the ſame doctrine whych our ſauior Chriſt &amp; hys apoſtles haue preached / vnles the ſame forme of doctrine / and of teaching be likewiſe kept: ſo is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that the matter of our prayer be ſuch as is in the word of God / vnles that the forme alſo be agreeable vnto the formes of prayers in the ſcripture. Now we haue no ſuch formes in the ſcripture / as that we ſhuld pray in .ij. or .iij. lines / and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after hauing red a while ſome other thing / come and pray as much more / and ſo to the .xx. and .xxx. time / wyth pauſes betweene.</p>
               <p>If a man ſhoulde come to a Prince / and keepe ſuche order in making hys petitions vnto hym / that hauing very many things to demaund / after he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded one thing / he would ſtay a long time / and then demaunde an other / and ſo the thirde / the prince myght well thinke / that eyther he came to aſke before he knew what he had nede of / or that he had forgotten ſome pece of hys ſute / or that he were diſtracted in hys vnderſtanding / or ſome other ſuch like cauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of his ſupplication. And therfore how much more conuenient were it / that according to the manner of the reformed churches: firſt the miniſter wyth an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and general confeſſion of faults / ſhuld deſire the aſſiſtance of the Lord / for the frutefull handling and receiuing of the word of God / and then after that we haue heard the Lord ſpeake vnto vs in hys worde by hys miniſter / the church ſhould likewiſe ſpeake vnto the Lord / and preſent all thoſe petitions and ſutes at once / bothe for the whole churche and for the Prince and all other eſtates whych ſhall be thought needefull.</p>
               <p>And if any will ſay that there are ſhort prayers found in the Actes / it may be anſweared / that S. Luke doth not expres the whole prayers at large / but only ſet downe the ſummes of them / and their cheefe poyntes. And further it may be anſweared / that alwayes thoſe praiers were continued together / and not cut off / and ſhred into diuers ſmall peeces.</p>
               <p>An other fault is / that all the people are appoynted in diuers places to ſaye after the miniſter / wherby not only the time is vnprofitably waſted / &amp; a confuſed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21261:72"/> voyce of the people one ſpeaking after an other cauſed / but an opinion bredde in their heads / that thoſe only be their prayers whych they ſay and pronounce with their owne mouthes / whych cauſeth them to geue the les heede to the reſt of the prayers whych they reherſe not after the miniſter / whych notwithſtanding are as well their prayers / as thoſe whych they pronounce after the miniſter / other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the order whych is left vnto the church of God dothe beare. For God hath ordained the miniſter to thys ende / that as in publike meetings / he only is the mouthe of the Lorde from hym to the people / euen ſo he ought to be only the mouthe of the people from them vnto the Lorde / and that all the people ſhoulde attende to that whych is ſayde by the miniſter / and in the ende bothe declare their conſent to that whych is ſayde / and there hope that it ſhall ſo be and come to pas whych is prayed / by the worde <hi>(Amen)</hi> as S. Paule declareth in the Epiſtle to <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 16. 2. <hi>apoll. pro chriſtianis.</hi>
                  </note> the Corinthians. And Iuſtine Martyr ſheweth to haue bene the cuſtome of the churches in hys time.</p>
               <p>Although theſe blots in the Common prayer / be ſuch as may eaſely enough appeare vnto any whych is not wedded to a preiudicate opinion / and that there is no great difficultye in thys matter / yet I knowe that thys treatiſe of prayer will be ſubiect to many reprehenſions / and that there will not be wanting ſome probable coloures alſo / wherby theſe things may be defended / if men wil ſet them ſelues to ſtriue and to contende: yet (for the deſire that I haue that theſe thyngs ſhould be amended / and for the inſtruction of the ſimpler whych are ſtudious of the truthe) I haue bene bolde to vtter that whych I thinke / not doubting alſo but that the light of the truthe ſhall be able to ſcatter all thoſe miſtes of reaſons / whych ſhall go about to darken the clearnes therof.</p>

               <p>MAiſter D. requireth that it ſhould be proued vnto him / that by priuate bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is ment baptiſme by wemen.

Secondarily / I would gladly aſke him who they be that are preſent / when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childe is ſo ſhortly after it is borne in great danger of death. And laſt of all M.

If he ment plainly heerein / there needed not ſo much adoe.</p>
               <p>The place of S. Mathew is as ſtrong againſt womens baptiſing / as it is <note place="margin">Chap. 28. 19.</note> againſt their preaching. For the miniſtery of the word and ſacraments can not be pulled in ſonder / whych the Lord hathe ioyned together from time to time. For Noah whych was a preacher vnto the olde world of the wil of God / was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo of God to make the Arke / whych was a Sacrament and ſeale of hys <note place="margin">2. Peter. 2. 5. Geneſ. 6. 14. Geneſ. 18. 19. Geneſ. 17. 23.</note> preaching touching the deſtruction of the world. And Abraham whom the Lord would haue to be the Doctor of hys church / whych was then in his family / was alſo commaunded to miniſter the Sacrament of circumciſion vnto hys familye. The prieſtes and Leuites whych were appoynted to teache the people / were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appoynted to ſacrifice / and to miniſter other ſacraments in the churche. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſame Prophets whych God ſtirred vp to preache / he alſo ordained to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame by ſignes and ſacraments. The ſame may be alſo brawne through out the new Teſtament / as vnto euery of the twelue / and afterward to the. 70. power was geuen / bothe to preache the goſpell / and alſo to confirme with ſignes <note place="margin">Luke. 9. 1. Luk. 10. 1. 17.</note> and miracles whych were ſeales of their doctrine.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21261:73"/> And S. Paule by the commaundement that oure ſauioure Chriſte gaue him to <note place="margin">Acts. 22. 15. 1. Cor. 1. 17.</note> preache / vndertoke alſo to baptiſe / althoughe there were no expres wordes that licenſed hym therevnto: for he knewe right well that it was the perpetuall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God / that the ſame ſhould be the miniſters of the word and ſacraments. Whervpon it followeth / that for as much as women may not preach the goſpel / no not by the lawes of the realme / that they ought not to miniſter baptiſme. But M. Doctor riſeth vp and ſayeth / that a woman in the time of neceſſitye / and when there is none other that eyther can or will preache / may preache the goſpell in the churche.</p>
               <p>This is ſtraunge doctrine / and ſuche as ſtrengtheneth the Anabaptiſtes handes / and ſauoureth ſtronger that wayes / then any one thyng in all the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition / whych is ſo often condemned of Anabaptiſme. Hys firſt reaſon to proue it / is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are examples therof. When we alledge the examples of all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the apoſtles times / to proue the election of the miniſter by the church / and in other caſes whych are generall examples approued and executed by the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles / contrary to no commaundement nor inſtitution of God / yea / and as hathe bene proued according to the commaundement of God / M. Doctor geueth vs oure anſwere in a worde / that examples proue not: nowe that the queſtion is to make good womens preaching in the churche / examples I will not ſaye of all churches / but of no one church / only of a fewe ſingulare perſons / not according to the commaundement of the worde of God / but cleane contrary to the preſcripte <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 34. 1. Tim. 2. 12.</note> worde of God / I ſay / nowe examples / and ſuche ſingulare examples are good proufes and ſtrong arguments.</p>
               <p>Now / if the ſpeache be a true meſſenger of the heart / I perceiue M. doctor is of this minde / that he would haue women preach in the church of England at thys time: for he can not deny (and he alſo confeſſeth it ſometimes) that thys is the time of neceſſity / &amp; in dede it muſt be needes an extreme neceſſity / that driueth to make one man paſtor of two churches / eſpecially ſo far diſtant / that driueth to make men which are not able to teach / miniſters / and diuers more things which are contrary to the word of God. Therfore this being a time of neceſſity / by M. Doctors iudgement we ought to haue women to preach. Beſides this he ſayth / if neither none other can or wil preache / that then women may preach / but in the moſt churches of thys realme / there is none that eyther can or will preach / there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there / and in thoſe churches women (at the leaſt if they be able) may preache the goſpell / and conſequently miniſter the ſacraments.</p>
               <p>In the. 187. page / he citeth M. Caluin in the. 13. chap. ſection. 32. to proue that women may teach: wherein I maruell what he meaneth ſo to alledge M. Caluin continually / he alledgeth the. 13. chapter and no booke / as thoughe he had wrytten but one boke / and in deede there is no ſuch thing in no ſuch chapter of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boke of hys inſtitutions / or in any other place throughout his whole workes / as I am perſwaded. If this faulte had bene but twiſe or thriſe / I woulde haue thought it had bene the printers / but now that it is continuall and ſo oftentimes / ſurely he geueth great ſuſpition / that eyther ſome bodye hathe mocked hym wyth theſe places / or els he would abuſe others / and eſpecially him that ſhould anſwer hys boke / ſetting him to ſeeke that he ſhould neuer finde.</p>
               <p>As for M. Caluins iudgement / what it is of womens preaching / it maye <note place="margin">4. <hi>lib. Inſtit. cap.</hi> 15. <hi>ſect.</hi> 20</note> appeare by that he will not by any meanes / no not in the time of neceſſitye (as they terme it) ſuffer either woman or any lay ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to baptiſe or miniſter any ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / and therfore not to preache. And as for the examples of Mary the ſiſter of Moyſes / of Olda / of Anna / and the daughters of Philip the euangeliſt / whych are all called prophetiſſes (for I thinke M. doctor meaneth theſe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples) as for them I ſay / it wil be hard for to ſhew that they euer propheſied / or taught openly in any publike meeting or congregation. But the ſurer anſwer is / that although
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21261:73"/> the Lorde doe ſometimes not being vnder any law chaunge the order which he hath ſet / in rayſing vp certayne women / partly to the ſhame of men / and to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them / partly to let them vnderſtand that he can / if he would / want their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: yet it is not lawfull for vs to draw that into example / and to follow it: or that for as much as he breaketh the law which is not ſubiect vnto it / and which he made not for hym ſelfe / that therefore we may breake the law whereunto we be ſubiect / and to whom it is geuen. But we muſt goe in the broade hygh way of the commaundement / and of the ordinary vſage of God in gouerning hys church / and not in the biepath of certayne ſingulare examples which haue beene in diuers ages. And as often as God hath vſed thys extraordinary meanes of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of women / ſo often alſo hath he confirmed their calling eyther by miracle or ſome wonderfull iſſue / or with ſome other ſingulare note and marke / wherby he hath made their calling otherwyſe ſtraunge and monſtruous / moſt certayne and vndoubted to all men.</p>
               <p>There is greater difficultie then M. Doctor mentioneth / in the wordes of <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 5.</note> S. Paule / where he ſayth a woman praying or Propheſying ought to be vailed / and haue her head couered / in which words it ſeemeth that the Apoſtle lycenceth a woman to prophecie / ſo that ſhee do it with her head couered. But to hym that ſhall diligently conſyder the place / it ſhall appeare / that the women of Corinth / dyd paſſe the boundes of modeſty and of ſhamefaſtneſſe / two wayes / whereof one was / that they came into the congregation contrary to the cuſtome of thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys / with theyr heades &amp; faces vncouered: an other was / that they alſo tooke vpon them to ſpeake in the congregation / both which faultes S. Paule condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned / but in their ſeuerall and proper places. Although therfore ſpeaking agaynſt the abuſe of vncouering theyr head / he doth not condemne their boldneſſe in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching / yet he dyd not therefore approue it / the confutation whereof he reſerued to a more commodious place. But ſayeth hee / if women do baptiſe / it is in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate houſes.</p>
               <p>I haue ſhewed before that they may not baptiſe at all / therefore not in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate houſes: beſides that that I haue in the Reply vnto the ſection in the one and twenty page ſhewed / how it is not lawfull neyther to preach the word / nor to miniſter the Sacramentes in priuate corners / for the which matter of not mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacramentes in priuate houſes / to the authors of the Admonition / ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the eleuenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle vnto the Corrinthians / M. Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor anſweareth that he reproueth the prophanation of the ſupper by banketting and contempt of their brethren / and exhorteth to tary one for an other.</p>
               <p>But what is thys to the purpoſe? we aſke not M. Doctor the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thys place / as we doe not of all the reſt which he interpreateth / where there is no occaſyon in the world to interpreate them / being of them ſelues very cleare / and the interpretation which is brought neuer almoſt making <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any thing for the ſolution of that which is obiected / which I deſire the Reader to marke through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hys whole booke. For what if S. Paule reproue the prophanation of the ſupper of the Lord / doth it follow therefore that he doth not geue to vnderſtand / that the Sacrament ſhould be adminiſtred in a common aſſembly? What if hee exhorte to tary one for an other / therefore dothe he not dehorte from celebrating of the ſacrament in a priuate houſe?</p>
               <p>And ſurely me thincke / you can not be ſo ignoraunt as you make your ſelfe / that you ſhould not vnderſtande their argument / and therefore I thinke you do rather diſſemble it / as you doe in diuers other places. For all men may eaſely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue / that as S. Paule oppoſeth the ſupper of the Lord / to the common ſupper: hys banket / to the common banket: ſo he oppoſeth there manifeſtly the church <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 20. 21. 22.</note> and congregation / vnto the pryuate houſe: and declareth that as the common ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or banket / ought to be kept at theyr houſes / ſo the Lordes ſupper and hys
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21261:74"/> banket / ought to be celebrated in the congregation.</p>
               <p>To the Admonition obiecting in the ninetie and two page that Iohn bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">Marc. 1. 5.</note> openly amongſt the congregation / he anſweareth and ſayth / that it may bee as well concluded that we ſhould baptiſe only in the riuer of Iordane / and none but thoſe that be of age. By which ſaying he geueth to vnderſtand / that to baptiſe in the church / hath no greater neceſſitie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baptiſing in Iordane / nor it ſkilleth no more whether baptiſme be myniſtred in the publike aſſembly / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is neceſſary or ſkilleth / whether we be baptiſed in the riuer of Iordane / &amp; that the baptiſme of yong infantes / hath no better groundes then priuate baptiſme hath. The later whereof (both being abſurde) is too too iniurious vnto the baptiſme of yong infantes. For as of our ſauioure Chriſtes preachinges in publyke places / and refuſing pryuate places / we doe gather that the preaching of the woorde ought to bee publike: euen ſo of S. Iohns preaching and baptiſing in open meetings / wee conclude that bothe preaching and baptyſing / oughte to bee in publike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
               <p>And although to ſome one action there concurre dyuers things / which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are not to be followed at all / partly are indifferent to be followed or not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: yet neyther the vnlawfulneſſe of the one to be followed / nor the indifferency of the other / can hynder / but there are other ſome things in the ſame action neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to bee followed. Which may be conſidered both of the place of the Actes / <note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> touching the election / where I haue proued ſome things there mentioned to be neceſſary to be done in elections / although other ſome be not conuenient nor fit for vs to follow. And I haue ſhewed it alſo by M. Caluine / which Maiſter Doctor alleageth for hym ſelfe / and by Cyprian / whoſe authoritie he woulde be loth to reiect I am ſure / leaſt he ſhould loſe the opynion of hys ſtudiouſneſſe of the olde wryters / which he hunteth ſo dyligently after in thys booke / and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he maketh the authors of the Admonition ſo great contemners. And it is not harde to ſhew the ſame in .xx. places more / as in S. Mathew and S. Luke / <note place="margin">Math. 10. Luk. 9. Luk. 10.</note> where / as there are dyuers things not to be followed of the myniſters now / other things indifferent to be followed / ſo are there alſo other things that be as well commaunded to all the myniſters that now are / as they were then eyther to the 12. or. 70. diſciples. And other reaſon he addeth there / that S. Peter baptiſed in Cornelius houſe. But M. Doctor maketh not the beſt choyſe of hys argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes / for S. Paules baptyſing in the houſe of the gayler / had bene more fit <note place="margin">16. Act. 33.</note> for hym. For vnto hys place it may be eaſely anſweared / that Cornelyus hauing ſo great a family as it is lyke he had / and beſides that dyuers ſouldiours vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath hym / and further hys freendes and hys acquaintance which he had called / had a competent number / and as many as woulde make a congregation / and as coulde commodiouſly be preached vnto in one place. But the anſwere to both theſe examples and other ſuche lyke / as that S. Paule baptyſed the houſe of <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 16.</note> Stephana is eaſie. For there being perſecutions at that tyme / ſo that it was not ſafe neyther for the myniſter / nor for the people to be ſeene / it was meete that they ſhoulde doe it in houſes / which otherwiſe they woulde haue done in open places. And then / thoſe houſes which receiued the congregation / were not as I haue ſhewed for the tyme to be counted priuate houſes. And further in places where the goſpell hath not bene receiued / nor no church gathered / but one only houſholde embracing the goſpell / I ſay in ſuche a caſe / and eſpecially in the tyme of perſecution / where ſhould the myniſters preach or myniſter the ſacramentes more conueniently / then in that houſe where thoſe profeſſors of the goſpell bee? Now to draw thys into our churches / which may ſafely come into open places / and where the church and congregation ſtandeth of dyuers houſholdes / is a token of great want of iudgement / in ſhuffelyng thoſe thyngs together / which for the great diuerſitie of their natures will not be mingled.</p>

               <p> And in the page. 152. he bringeth other reaſons to proue that the ſacraments may be myniſtred in a priuate houſe / whereof the firſt is / that our ſauiour Chriſt celebrated his ſupper in a priuate houſe / and in an inner parlour / the reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is eaſely to be knowne / for the law of God ordayned that euery houſholder in hys houſe ſhould eate the paſſeouer with hys owne family / if it were ſo great / as that they might well eate vp a whole Lambe.</p>
               <p>Our ſauiour Chriſt therfore with hys houſholde / obſerueth thys law / and for becauſe he would declare that the paſſeouer had hys ende / and that hys holy ſacrament of the ſupper ſhould come in place thereof / he doth forthwith celebrate it in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame place. Which if he had not done / neyther could he haue done it at al (the houre of hys apprehenſion then approching) neyther ſhould it ſo liuely haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared / that eyther the paſſeouer was abolyſhed / or that the ſupper came in place of it / being celebrated both at an other tyme / &amp; in an other place. For the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſupper in houſes in the Apoſtles tymes / and in Iuſtins and Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tymes / which were tymes of perſecution / I haue ſpoken before / where alſo I declared that ſuch houſes for the tyme are not priuate but publike.</p>
               <p>And theſe are hys reaſons wherewith he wold proue / that the ſacraments / and therefore alſo the ſacrament of baptiſme / may be myniſtred in a priuate houſe. He hath certayne other to proue that women may baptiſe / whereof the firſt is in the. 93. page / and that is / that Sephora Moſes wyfe / circumciſed her chylde / whereunto I haue anſweared partly before / that particular examples / eſpecially contrary to generall rules / are not to be followed / and will further anſwere / if I firſt admoniſhe the reader / wherupon thys baptiſme of mydwiues and in priuate houſes roſe / that when we know of how rotten a ſtocke it came / the frute it ſelfe may be more lothſome vnto vs. It firſt therfore roſe vpon a falſe interpretation of the place of S.

               <p>Vpon thys falſe concluſion of S. Auguſtine / hath ryſen thys prophanation of the ſacrament of baptiſme / in being myniſtred in pryuate houſes / &amp; by women or lay men / as alſo vpon hys other abſurde concluſion / ſprong a horrible abuſe of

Hereupon may be added an other cauſe / which is that as (when the church began not only to declyne / but to fall away from the ſincerity of relygion) it borowed a number of other prophanations of the Heathen: ſo alſo it borowed thys.

               <p>Now I returne to the example of Sephora / and ſay that the vnlawfulnes of that fact doth appeare ſuffyciently in that ſhee dyd it / before her huſband Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes / which was a Prophet of the Lord / and to whome that office of circumcyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dyd appertayne: ſo that vnleſſe M. Doctor would haue mydwyues baptiſe in the preſence of the byſhop or the myniſter / there is no cauſe why he ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thys place. Beſides that ſhee dyd cutte of that foreſkin of the infant not of mynde to obey the commaundement of God / or for the ſaluation of the childe / but in a choler only / to the ende that her huſbande myght be eaſed and haue releaſe: which mynde appeareth in her / both by her wordes / and by caſting away in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the forſkin which ſhe had cutte of. And if it be ſayde that the euent declared that the act pleaſed God / becauſe that Moſes forthwith waxed better / and was recouered of hys ſickneſſe / I haue ſhewed before / how if we meaſure thinges by the euent / we ſhall oftentymes iuſtifie the wicked / and take the righteouſneſſe of the righteous from them. An other reaſon he hath / which is / that the dignitie of the ſacramentes doth not depende vpon the man / whether he be myniſter or no myniſter / good or euill.</p>
               <p>In deede vpon thys poynt whether he be a good or an euill myniſter it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not / but on thys poynt / whether he be a myniſter or no / dependeth not only the dignitie / but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> being of the ſacrament: ſo that I take the baptiſme of women / to be no more the holy ſacrament of baptiſme / then I take any other dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ordinary waſhing of the childe. Neyther lette any man thincke / that I haue at vnwares ſlipped into thys aſſeueration / or that I haue forgotten / that ſone after the times of the Apoſtles / it was the vſe of certayne churches / that deacons ſhould baptiſe in the tyme of neceſſitie (as they call it.) For as for the baptiſme of deacons / I holde it to be lawfull / for becauſe although (as it is wyth vs) they geue hym the name of deacon / yet in deede he is / as he then was in the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tymes a myniſter / and not a deacon. And although he dyd then prouide for the poore / and ſo had two functions (which was not meete) yet hys office ought to be eſteemed of the principall part of hys function / which was preaching and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of the Sacramentes / in certen caſes. And as for the baptyſing by lay men / conſydering that it is not only agaynſt the word of God / but alſo founded vpon a falſe grounde / and vpon an imagined neceſſitie (which is none in deede) it moueth me nothing at all / although it be very auncient / for ſo much as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſacrament depended cheefely of the inſtitution and worde of God / which is the forme / and as it were the life of the Sacrament / of which inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thys is one / and of the cheefe partes / that it ſhould be celebrated by a myniſter. For although part of the inſtitution / in that the name of the holy Trinitie is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon / be obſerued: yet if the whole inſtitution be not / it is no more a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / then the papiſtes communion was / which celebrating in one kynde / tooke a part of the inſtitution / and left the other. And for ſo much as S. Paule ſayeth / <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 15.</note> that a man can not preach which is not ſent / no not although he ſpeake the words
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21261:75"/> of the ſcripture and interpreate them: ſo I can not ſee / how a man can baptiſe / vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that he be ſent to that end / although he poure water and rehearſe the words which are to be rehearſed in the miniſtery of baptiſme. I know there be dyuers difficultyes in thys queſtion / and therefore I was lothe to enter into it / but that the anſwearer ſetteth downe ſo confidently / that it maketh no matter for the truth of baptiſme / whether he be myniſter or no myniſter / and ſo whether one haue a calling or no calling. Wherein notwithſtanding he doth not only by hys often handling of one thing / confounde hys reader / but hym ſelfe alſo / and forgetteth that he is in an other queſtion then which is propounded. For although it ſhould be graunted hym / that the ſacrament doth not depende vpon that / yet hath he not that which he would haue / that women may baptiſe. For it is one thing to ſay the baptiſme which is myniſtred by women / is good and effectuall / and an other thing to ſay that it is lawfull for women to myniſter baptiſme. For there is no man doubteth: but that the baptiſme which is myniſtred by an hereticall myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is effectuall / and yet I thincke that M. Doctor will not ſay / that therefore an hereticall myniſter may baptiſe / and that it is lawfull for heretikes to baptiſe in the church. And therfore men muſt not only take heede (as M. Doctor ſayth) that they vſurpe not that which they are not called vnto / but they muſt alſo take heede that they receyue not functions and charges vpon them / whereof they are not capable / although they be thereunto called.</p>
               <p>In the 153. page M. Bucers cenſure vpon the communion booke is cited / for the allowance of that it hath touching priuate baptiſme / and conſequently of the baptiſme by women. It may be / that as M. Bucer although otherwyſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learned hath other groſe abſurdities / ſo he may haue that. But it had bene for the credite of your cauſe / if you had ſhewed that out of thoſe wrytinges / which are publyſhed and known to be his / and not out of thoſe wherof men may doubt / whether euer he wrote any ſuche or no: and if hee wrote / whether they be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by thoſe into whoſe handes they came. And if you would take any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of M.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21261:76"/> of the Admonition obiect that neceſſitie of ſaluation is tyed to the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes by thys meanes / and that men are confirmed in that olde error / that no man can be ſaued with out baptiſme / which in deede is true. For muſt it not bee thought to be done of neceſſitie / and vpon great extremity / for the doing whereof the orders that God hath ſet (that it ſhould be done in the congregation / &amp; by the myniſter of the goſpell) are broken? Yes verely. And I will further ſay / that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the infants which dye without baptiſme ſhould be aſſuredly damned (which is moſt falſe) yet ought not the orders which God hath ſet in his church / to be broken after thys ſort. For as the ſaluation of men ought to be deare vnto vs: ſo the glory of God which conſiſteth in that hys orders be kept / ought to bee much more deare / that if at any tyme the controuerſy could be betwene hys glory and our ſaluation / our ſaluation ought to fall that hys glory may ſtand.</p>
               <p>Now in the 187. page M. Doctor anſweareth heereunto / that thys imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more that the ſaluation is tyed to the ſacramentes / then when it is taught that infants muſt be baptyſed / and not tary vntill they come to the age of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which how truely it is ſpoken / when as the one hath ground of the ſcripture / the other hath none / the one approued by the continuall / and almoſt the generall practiſe of the church / the other vſed in the corrupt and rotten eſtate thereof / let all men iudge. Therefore for ſo much as the myniſtery of the worde and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes goe together / &amp; that the myniſtery of the word may not be committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to women / and for that thys euill cuſtome hath ryſen fyrſt of a falſe vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſcripture / and then of a falſe concluſion of that vntrue vnderſtanding (which is / that they can not be ſaued which are not baptiſed) and for that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors them ſelues of that error / did neuer ſeeke no remedy of the miſcheefe in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens or priuate baptim: And laſt of all for that if there were any remedy agaynſt that miſchefe in ſuch kynde of baptiſme / yet it ought not to be vſed / being agaynſt the inſtitution of God &amp; hys glory / I conclude that the priuate baptiſme / and by women is vtterly vnlawfull. There followeth the priuate communion which is found fault with / both for the place wherein it is myniſtred / &amp; for the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of communicants which are admitted / by the bocke of ſeruice. Touching the place before is ſpoken ſufficiently / it reaſteth to conſider of the number. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to that / I will ſpeake ſome thing of the cauſes &amp; beginning of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in houſes / &amp; of the myniſtring of the Communion vnto ſicke folkes. It is not to be denyed / but that thys abuſe is very auncient / and was in Iuſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs tyme / in Tertullians and Cyprians tyme / euen as alſo there were other abuſes crept into the ſupper of the Lord / and that very groſe / as the mingling of water with wine / and therein alſo a neceſſitie and great myſtery placed / as it may appeare both by Iuſtine Martyr and Cyprian. Which I therefore by the way doe admoniſh the reader of / that the antiquity of thys abuſe of pryuate communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / bee not preiudiciall to the truthe / no more then the mingling of water / with that opynion of neceſſitie / that thoſe fathers had of it / is or oughte to bee preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to that that wee vſe in myniſtring the cuppe with pure wine according to the inſtytution. I ſay therefore that thys abuſe was auncient / and roſe vpon theſe cauſes. Firſt of all in the prymitiue church the dyſcipline of the churche was ſo ſeuere and ſo extreame / that if any which profeſſed the truth / and were of the body of the church / did through infirmitie deny the truth / &amp; ioyned hym ſelf vnto the idolatrous ſeruice / although he repenting came againe vnto the church / yet was he not receiued to the communion of the Lords ſupper any more. And yet lying in extremitie of ſickenes / and redy to depart thys lyfe / if hee dyd require the communion in token that the church had forgeuen the faulte / and was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyled altogether vnto that perſon that had ſo fallen / they graunted that he might be partaker of it / as may appeare by the ſtory of Serapion. Another cauſe was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 43.</note> that which was before alleaged / which is the falſe opynion which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21261:76"/>
/ that all thoſe were condemned / that receiued not the ſupper of the Lord / &amp; therfore when as thoſe that were (as they called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>cathecumeni)</hi> which is yong nouices in relygion neuer admitted to the ſupper / or yong children fell ſicke daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly / they myniſtred the ſupper of the Lord vnto them / leaſt they ſhould want their voyage victuall (as they termed it) which abuſe notwithſtanding was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo auncient as the other / nor ſo generall. And there wanted not good men which declared their miſlyking / and dyd decree agaynſt both the abuſes / &amp; agaynſt all maner communicating in priuate houſes. As in the councell of * Laodicea it <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>canon.</hi> 58.</note> was ordayned that neyther byſhop nor elder ſhuld make any oblation / that was / myniſter any communion in houſes. Beſides therfore that I haue before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vnlawfulneſſe generally of myniſtring the ſacrament in priuate places / ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the cuſtome of myniſtring thys ſupper vnto the ſicke / roſe vpon corrupt cauſes and rotten foundations / &amp; conſidering alſo (God be prayſed) in theſe times there are none dryuen by feare to renounce the truth / whereupon any ſuch excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication ſhould enſue / which in the extremitie of ſickneſſe ſhould be mitigated after thys ſort (for no man now that is in extreame ſickneſſe / is caſt downe or elſe aſſaulted with thys temptation y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is cut of from the church) I ſay theſe things conſidered / it followeth that thys myniſtring of communion in priuate houſes &amp; to the ſicke is vnlawfull / as that which roſe vpon euil groundes: &amp; if it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full / yet that now in theſe times of peace / &amp; when the ſicke are not excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted / there is no vſe of it. And ſo it appeareth / how little the cuſtome of the olde church doth helpe M. Doctor in thys poynt.</p>
               <p>And as for that he ſayth Peter Martyr &amp; Bucer / doe allow the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on exhibited to the ſicke perſons / when he ſheweth that / he ſhal haue anſwer. For wher he ſaith he hath declared it in an other treatiſe / either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Printer hath left out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treatiſe / or M. Doc. wonderfully forgetteth hym ſelfe / or elſe he meaneth ſome odde thing / that he hath written / &amp; layd vp in ſome corner of his ſtudy. For ſurely there is no ſuch ſaying in all hys boke before / nor yet after / ſo far as I can finde.</p>
               <p>Now remayneth to be ſpoken of the number of communicants / &amp; that there is fault in the appoynting of the ſeruice booke / not only for that it admitteth in the tyme of plage / that one with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myniſter may celebrate the ſupper of the Lord in the houſe / but for that it ordayneth a communion in the church / when of a great number which aſſemble there / it admitteth three or fower / the abuſe and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience whereof may thus bee conſidered. The holy ſacrament of the ſupper of the Lorde / is not only a ſeale and confirmation of the promiſes of God vnto vs / but alſo a profeſſion of our coniunction / as well with Chriſt our ſauiour and with God / as alſo (as S. Paule teacheth) a declaration and profeſſion that wee <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 17.</note> are at one with oure brethren: ſo that it is fyrſt a ſacrament of the knitting of all the body generally / and of euery member particularly with the heade / and then of the members of the body one with an other. Now therefore ſeeing that euery particular church and body of Gods people / is a repreſentation / and as it were a liuely portraiture of the whole church and body of Chriſt / it followeth that that which we can not doe with all the church ſcattered throughout the whole world (for the diſtances of places whereby we are ſeuered) we ought to doe with that church whereunto God hath raunged vs / as much as poſſibly or conueniently may be. The departing therefore of the reſt of the church from thoſe three or fower / is an open profeſſion that they haue no communion / fellowſhippe / nor v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with them / that doe communicate: and lykewiſe of thoſe three or foure / that they haue none with the reſt that ioyne not them ſelues thereunto: when as both by the many grapes making one cuppe / and cornes making one loafe / that whole church being many parſons / are called as to the vnitie which they haue one with an other / and altogether amongſt them ſelues: ſo to the declaration and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it / by receiuing one with an other / and altogether amongſt them ſelues:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21261:77"/> And as if ſo be that we do not celebrate as we may poſſibly and conueniently / the ſupper of the Lord / we thereby vtter our want of loue towardes the Lord which hath redeemed vs: ſo if we doe not communicate together with the churche / ſo farre forth as we may do conueniently / we betray the want of our loue that we haue one towardes an other. And therefore S. Paul dryuing heereunto / willeth <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 33.</note> that one ſhoulde tary for an other / reprehending that when one preuenteth and commeth before an other / ſaying: that that is to take euery man hys owne ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per / and not to celebrate the Lords ſupper. Not that ſo many men or women as there came / ſo many tables were / for that had not bene poſſible in ſo great aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes / but that they ſorted them ſelues into certayne companyes / and that they came ſcattering one after an other / and that in ſtead of making one ſupper of the Lord / they dyd make dyuers.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being conſidered / the reaſon which the Admonition vſeth in the 185. page / where thys matter is ſpoken of / which is / drinke you all of thys / is not ſo rydiculous as M. Doctor maketh it. For although that it doe neyther proue that 12. or 20. or any other definite number muſt of neceſſitie receyue / yet it proueth that as all they which were preſent / dyd communicate: And ſo as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as in the church are fit to receiue the ſacraments / or may conueniently receiue them together / ſhoulde follow that example in celebrating the ſupper together. And it is probably to be thought / that if our ſauiour Chriſt had not bene reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the law of God touching the paſſeouer vnto hys owne family and to as many onely as would ſerue to eate vppe a Lambe by them ſelues / that he would <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 3.</note> haue celebrated hys ſupper / amongſt other of hys diſciples and profeſſoures of hys doctryne. But for ſo muche as it was meete that hee ſhoulde celebrate hys ſupper there and then / where and when hee dyd celebrate hys paſſeouer / for the cauſe before by me alleaged / it pleaſed hym to keepe hys firſt ſupper with the fewer / for that the law of communication vnto the paſſeouer / which was ioyned wyth the ſupper / woulde not admit any greater number of communicants / then was ſufficient to eate vp the paſſeouer.</p>
               <p>And althoughe it be cleare and playne / that when it is ſayde drincke ye all of thys / and tary one for an other / theſe ſayinges are ment of that particulare congregation or aſſembly / which aſſemble themſelues together to be taught by one mouth of the myniſter: yet I haue therefore put thys caution (as muche as may be poſſyble) leaſt any man ſhoulde cauill / as though I would haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion / vntill all the godly through the world ſhould meete together. Likewiſe I haue put thys caution (as much as may be conueniently) for although it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible / that a perticulare church may communicate at one table in one day and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: yet maye the ſame be inconuenient for dyuers cauſes. As if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould be very great / ſo that to haue them all communicate together / it would require ſuche a long tyme / as the tarying out of the whole action / would hazarde eyther the lyfe / or at leaſt the health of dyuers there. Agayne / for as much as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome being at the churche / it is meete that other ſhould be at home / vppon occaſyon of infantes and ſuche lyke thinges / as require the preſence of ſome to tary at home. In theſe caſes and ſuche lyke / the inconueniences doe delyuer vs from the gilte of vncharitablenes / and forſaking the fellowſhip of the church / for that wee doe not heere ſeuere oure ſelues / but are by good and iuſt cauſes ſeuered: which gilte wee ſhall neuer eſcape / if beſide ſuche neceſſarye cauſes wee pretende thoſe that are not / or hauing not ſo muche as a pretence / yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wythſtanding ſeperate our ſelues / as the dayly practiſe thorough out the church doth ſhew.</p>
               <p>But it may be obiected / that in thys poynt the booke of Common prayer is not in fault / which doth not only not forbid that all the church ſhould receiue together / but alſo by a good &amp; godly exhortation moueth thoſe that be preſent / that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21261:77"/> they ſhould not departe / but communicate altogether. It is true that it doth not forbid / and that there is godly exhortation for that purpoſe / but that (I ſay) is not enough / for neither ſhould it ſuffer that three or foure ſhould haue a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by them ſelues (ſo many being in the church meete to receiue / and to whom the ſupper of the Lord doth of right appertaine) &amp; it ought to prouide / that thoſe whych woulde wythdrawe them ſelues / ſhoulde be by Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline / at all times / and now alſo vnder a godly Prince by ciuill puniſhment brought to communicate wyth their brethren. And thys is the law of God / and thys is now and hath bene heeretofore the practiſe of churches reformed. All men vnderſtand that the paſſeouer was a figure of the Lords ſupper / and that there ſhould be as ſtraight bonds to binde men to celebrate the remembrance of our ſpirituall deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance / as there was to remember the deliuerance out of Egipt. But whoſoeuer did not then communicate with the reſt at that time / when the paſſeouer was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten / was excommunicated / as it may appeare in the boke of Numbers / where he <note place="margin">Num. 9. 13.</note> ſayeth / that whoſoeuer did not communicate being cleane / his ſoule ſhould be cut off from amongſt the people of God. Therfore thys neglect / or contempt rather of the Lordes ſupper / ought to be puniſhed wyth no les puniſhment / eſpecially when as (after the church hath proceeded in that order whych our ſauior Chriſt appoynteth of admoniſhing) they be not ſory for their fault / and promiſe amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that this was the cuſtome of the churches / it may appeare by the. 9. of thoſe canons / whych are fathered of the apoſtles / wher it is decreed that all the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Apo. canon.</hi> 9.</note> faithfull that entred into the congregation / and heard the ſcriptures red / and dyd not tary out the prayers &amp; the holy Communion / ſhould be as thoſe whych were cauſers of diſorders in the church / ſeperated from the church / (or as it is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of an other) depriued of the Communion. Alſo in the councell of Braccara it <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc.</hi> 2. <hi>Bracca cap.</hi> 83. <hi>tom.</hi> 2.</note> was decreed / that if any entring into the church of God / heard the Scriptures / and afterward of wantonnes or loſenes / wythdrewe hym ſelfe from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſacrament / and ſo brake the rule of diſcipline in the reuerende ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments / ſhould be put out of the church / till ſuch time as he had by good frutes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared hys repentaunce.</p>
               <p>But heere alſo may riſe an other doubt of the former wordes of Moſes in the boke of Numbers / for ſeing that he maketh thys exception (if they be cleane) it may be ſayd / that thoſe that depart / do not fele themſelues mete to receiue / and therfore depart / the other .iij. or .iiij. or moe / feele themſelues meete and diſpoſed for that purpoſe: whervpon it may ſeeme that it is neither reaſon to compell thoſe to come / which feele not themſelues meete / nor to reiect them that feele that good diſpoſition and preparation in themſelues. For anſwer whervnto / we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the vncleannes whych Moyſes ſpeaketh of / was ſuch as men could not eaſely auoid / and whervnto they might fall ſometimes by neceſſary duety / as by handling their dead / whych they were by the rule of charitye bound to burye / ſometimes by touching at vnwares a deade body / or by ſitting in the place where ſome vncleane body had ſitten / or by touching ſuch things whych the law iudged vncleane / which thing cannot be alleaged in thoſe that are now of the church. For as many as be of it / and wythall of ſuche diſcretion as are able to proue and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelues / can haue no excuſe at all / if they may be at the church / to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelues from the holy ſupper of the Lord. For if they will ſay that they be not meete / it may be anſwered vnto them / that it is their owne fault: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / if they be not meete to receiue the holy ſacrament of the ſupper / they are not meete to heare the woord of God / they are not meete to be partakers of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the church / and if they be for one / they are alſo for the other. For with that boldnes / and wyth that duetye or lawfulnes (I ſpeake of thoſe whych are of the church / and of diſcretion to examine themſelues) I ſay wyth what lawfulnes they may offer themſelues to the prayers / and to the hearing of the word of God / 
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21261:78"/> they may alſo offer themſelues vnto the Lordes ſupper. And to whomſoeuer of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord wil communicate himſelfe by preaching the word / vnto the ſame he wil not refuſe to communicate himſelfe by receiuing of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is of Gods houſholde and familye / he neede not be afraide to come to the Lords table / nor dout but that the Lord will fede him there: and whatſoeuer he be that is a membre of the body of Chriſt / may be aſſured that he receiueth life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt the head as well by the arteries &amp; condints of the ſupper of the Lord / as by the preaching of the word of God. So that it muſt needes folow / that the not receiuing of thoſe whych depart out of the church / whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is any communion celebrated / procedeth either of vaine and ſuperſtitious feare / growing of groſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of themſelues and of the holy ſacraments: or elſe of an intollerable negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or rather contempt / of the whych neither the one nor the other ſhuld be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther borne wyth or nouriſhed / either by permitting .iij. or .iiij. to communicate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone / or els in letting them whych depart / go ſo eaſely away with ſo great a fault / whych ought to be ſeuerely puniſhed. And vpon thys either contempt or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious feare drawne from the papiſts Lenton preparation of. 40. dayes / eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrift / diſpling. &amp;c. it commeth to pas / that men receyuing the ſupper of the Lord but ſeldome / when they fall ſicke muſt haue the ſupper miniſtred vnto them in their houſes / whych otherwiſe being once euery weke receiued before / ſhould not brede any ſuch vnquietnes in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / when they can not come to receiue it. Although as I haue before ſhewed / if they had neuer receiued it before / yet that priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing were not at any hand to be ſuffered. And thus hauing declared what I thinke to be faulty in the communion boke in thys poynt / and the reaſons why / and wyth all anſweared to that whych eyther M. doctor alleageth in thys place of the. 80. and. 81. and likewiſe in the. 152. &amp;. 185. pages touching thys matter / I come now vnto that whych is called the Iewiſhe purifying by the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / and by the ſeruice boke afore time the purification of women.</p>
               <p>Now to the churching of women / in the which title yet kept / there ſeemeth to be hid a great part of the Iewiſh purification.

               <p>The holy dayes folow / of whych M. Doctor ſayth / that ſo they be not vſed ſuperſtitiouſly or vnprofitably they may be commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. I haue ſhewed before / that they were. If they were ſo indifferent as they are made / yet being kept of the papiſtes whych are the enemies of God / they ought to be aboliſhed. And if it were as eaſy a matter to pull oute the ſuperſtition of the obſeruing of thoſe holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes out of mennes heartes / as it is to proteſt and to teache that they are not commaunded for any religion to be put in them / or for any to make conſcience of the obſeruing of them / as thoughe there wereſome neceſſary worſhyp of God in the keping of them: then were they much more tollerable. But when as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of them doth noriſhe wicked ſuperſtition in the mindes of men / and that the doctrine whych ſhuld remedy the ſuperſtition through the fewnes &amp; ſkarcitye of able miniſters / can not come to the moſt part of them whych are infected wyth this diſeaſe / and that alſo where it is preached / the frute therof is in part hindred / whyleſt the common people attend oftentymes rather to that whych is done / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that whych is taught / being a thyng indifferent (as it is ſayd) it ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolyſhed / as that whych is not only not fitteſt to holde the people in the ſincere worſhypping of God / but alſo as that whych keepeth them in their former blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and corrupt opinions whych they haue conceyued of ſuch holy dayes. And if they had bene neuer abuſed neyther by the Papiſtes nor by the Iewes (as they haue bene and are daily) yet ſuche making of holy dayes is neuer wythout ſome great daunger of brynging in ſome euill and corrupt opinions into the mindes of men. I will vſe an example in one / and that the chefe of holy dayes / &amp; moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally &amp; of longeſt time obſerued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church / whych is the feaſt of Eaſter / whych was kept of ſome more dayes of ſome fewer. How many thouſands are there / I will not ſay of the ignorant papiſtes / but of thoſe alſo whych profeſſe the goſpell / whych when they haue celebrated thoſe dayes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dilygent heede taken vnto their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21261:79"/> life / and wyth ſome earneſt deuotion in praying and hearing the word of God / do not by and by thinke / that they haue well celebrated the feaſt of Eaſter / and yet haue they thus notably deceiued them ſelues. For S. Paul teacheth that the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 8.</note> of the feaſt of the chriſtians Eaſter / is not as the Iewes Eaſter was / for certen dayes / but ſheweth that we muſt keepe thys feaſt all the dayes of oure life in the vnleauened bread of ſincerity and of truth. By whych we ſee that the obſeruing of the feaſt of Eaſter for certain dayes in the yeare / doth pul out of our mindes or euer we be aware / the doctrine of the goſpell / and cauſeth vs to reſt in that neare conſideration of our dueties for the ſpace of a few dayes / which ſhould be extended to alour life. But beſides the incommodities that riſe of making ſuch holy dayes / and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing of thoſe whych are ſo horribly abuſed / where it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that they are not neceſſary: beſides this / I ſay the matter is not ſo indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as it is made. I confes that it is in the power of the churche to appoynt ſo many dayes in the weeke or in the yeare (in the whych the congregation ſhal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble to heare the word of God / and receiue the ſacraments / and offer vp pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto God) as it ſhall thinke good according to thoſe rules whych are before alleaged. But y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it hath power to make ſo many holy dayes (as we haue) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no man may worke any parte of the day / and wherin men are commaunded to ceaſe from their daily vocations of plowing and exerciſing their handy crafts. &amp;c. that I deny to be in the power of the church. For proufe wherof I will take the fourth commaundement / and no other interpretation of it / then M. doctor allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of in the. 174. page / whych is / that God licenſeth / and leaueth it at the liberty of euery man to worke ſixe dayes in the weeke / ſo that he reſt the ſeuenth daye. Seeing that therefore that the Lord hath left it to all men at libertye / that they myght labor (if they thinke good) ſixe dayes: I ſay the church nor no man can take thys liberty away from them / and driue them to a neceſſary reſt of the body. And if it be lawfull to abridge the liberty of the church in thys poynt / and in ſtead that the Lord ſayth ſixe dayes thou mayſt labor if thou wilt / to ſay thou ſhalt not labor ſixe dayes: I do not ſee why the church may not as well / wheras the Lord ſayth thou ſhalt reſt the ſeuenth day / commaunde that thou ſhalt not reſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day. For if the church may reſtraine the liberty that God hath geuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / it may take away the yoke alſo that God hath put vpon them.</p>
               <p>And whereas you ſay in the. 173. page / that notwithſtanding thys fourthe commaundement / the Iewes had certaine other feaſtes whych they obſerued: in deede the Lord whych gaue thys generall law / might make as many exceptions as he thought good / and ſo long as he thought good. But it foloweth not becauſe the Lord did it / that therfore the church may do it / vnles it hath commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and authority from God ſo to do. As when there is any generall plague or iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God either vpon the churche / or comming towardes it / the Lorde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth in ſuche a caſe that they ſhould ſanctifie a generall faſt / and proclaime <note place="margin">Ioel. 2. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>ghnatſarah,</hi> whych ſignifieth a prohibition or forbidding of ordinary works / and is the ſame Hebrewe word wherwyth thoſe feaſtes dayes are noted in the lawe wherin they ſhuld reſt. The reaſon of whych commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of the Lord was / that as they abſtained that day as much as might be conueniently from meat / ſo they might abſtaine from their daily workes / to the ende they might beſtowe the whole day in hearing the word of God / and humbling themſelues in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation / confeſſing their faultes / and deſiring the Lorde to turne away from hys fearce wrathe. In thys caſe the churche hauing commaundement to make a holy day / may and ought to do it / as the church which was in Babilon did / during the time of their captiuity: but where it is deſtitute of a commaundement / it may not preſume by any decree to reſtraine that liberty whych the Lord hath geuen.</p>
               <p>Nowe that I haue ſpoken generally of holy dayes / I come vnto the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and other ſaints dayes / whych are kept wyth vs. And thoughe it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21261:79"/> for the church to ordaine holy dayes to our ſauioure Chriſte or to the bleſſed Trinity: yet it is not therfore lawfull to inſtitute holy dayes to the apoſtles and other ſaintes / or to their remembrance. For although I confes as muche as you ſay in the. 153. page / that the church of England doth not meane by thys keping of holy dayes that the ſaintes ſhoulde be honoured / or as you alledge in the. 175. and. 176. pages / that wyth vs the ſaints are not prayed vnto / or that it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them as meritorious / yet that is not enough. For as we reaſon againſt the popiſh purgatorie / that it is therfore naught / for as much as neyther in the olde Teſtament nor in the newe / there is any mention of prayer at any time for the dead: ſo may it be reaſoned againſt theſe holy dayes ordained for the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of the ſaintes / that for ſo much as the old people dyd neuer keepe any feaſt or holy day for the remembrance eyther of Moſes or Daniel / or Iob / or Abraham / or Dauid / or any other / how holy or excellent ſo euer they were: nor the apoſtles nor the churches in their time neuer inſtituted any eyther to kepe the remembrance of Stephen / or of the virgin Mary / or of Iohn Baptiſt / or of any other notable and rare perſonage / that the inſtituting and erecting of them nowe / and thys at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by the churches whych folowed / whych haue not ſuch certen and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted interpreaters of the will of God / as the prophets and apoſtles were whych lyued in thoſe churches / is not wythout ſome note of preſumption / for that it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh thoſe thyngs whych the primitiue churche in the apoſtles times (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing greater giftes of the ſpirite of God then they that folowed them had) durſte not venter vpon.</p>
               <p>Moreouer I haue ſhewed before / what force the name of euery thyng hath to cauſe men to thynke ſo of euery thyng / as it is named / and therfore although you ſay in the. 175. page that in calling theſe holy dayes the dayes of ſuche or ſuch a Sainte / there is nothyng elſe meante but that the Scriptures whych are that day red / concerne that ſaynte / and contayne eyther hys callyng / preachyng / perſecution / martyrdom. &amp;c. yet euery one doth not vnderſtand ſo much. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the corrupt cuſtome of popery hath caryed theyr mindes to an other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation / the very name and appellation of the day teacheth otherwiſe. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the dayes dedicated to the Trinity / and thoſe that are conſecrate to our ſauior Chriſt / are in that they be called Trinity day or the Natiuity day of our ſauior Chriſt / by and by taken to be inſtituted to the honor of our ſauyor Chriſte and of the Trinity: ſo lykewyſe the people / when it is called S. Paules day / or the bleſſed virgin Maryes day / can vnderſtand nothing therby / but that they are inſtituted to the honor of S. Paule or of the virgin Mary / vnles they be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe taught. And if you ſay let them ſo be taught / I haue anſweared that the teaching in thys lande can not by any order whych is yet taken come to the moſte parte of thoſe / whych haue drunke thys poyſon: and where it is taught / it were good that the names were abolyſhed / that they ſhould not helpe to vnteach that / whych the preaching teacheth in thys behalfe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore / ſeeing the holy dayes be ceremonies of the church / I ſee not why we may not heere renue Auguſtines complaint / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the eſtate of the Iewes was more tollerable then oures is (I ſpeake in thys poynt of holy dayes) for if their holy dayes and oures be accompted / we ſhallbe fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to haue more then dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as many holy dayes as they had. And as for all the commodityes whych we receiue by them / whereby M. doctor goeth about to proue the goodnes and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of their inſtitution / as that the ſcriptures are there red and expounded / the patience of thoſe ſaintes in their perſecution and Martyrdome is to the edifying of the church remembred / and yearely renewed: I ſay / that we myght haue all thoſe commodities wythout all thoſe dangers whych I haue ſpoken of / &amp; wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any keping of yearely memory of thoſe ſayntes / and (as it falleth out) in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more profitable ſorte. For as I ſayd before of the keping of Eaſter / that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21261:80"/> it tyeth / and (as it were) fettereth a meditation of the Eaſter to a fewe dayes / whych ſhould reache to all our age and time of oure lyfe: ſo thoſe celebrations of the memories of ſaintes and martyrs / ſtreighten our conſideration of them vnto thoſe dayes / whych ſhould continually be thought of / &amp; daily as long as we liue. And if that it be thoughte ſo good and profitable a thyng that thys remembrance of them ſhould be vpon thoſe dayes / wherin they are ſuppoſed to haue dyed / yet it foloweth not therefore that after thys remembrance is celebrated by hearing the ſcriptures concerning them / and prayers made to folowe their conſtancy / that all the reſt of the day ſhould be kept holy in ſuch ſorte / as men ſhould be debarred of their bodely labors / and of exerciſing their daily vocations.</p>
               <p>Nowe where as maiſter Doctor citeth Auguſtine and Ierome / to proue that in the Churches in their times / there were holy dayes kepte beſydes the Lordes day / he myght haue alſo cited Ignatius and Tertullian / and Cyprian / whych are of greater auncienty / and would haue made more for the credit of hys cauſe / ſeeing he meaſureth all hys truthe almoſte throughe the whole booke / by the croked meaſure and yarde of time. For it is not to be denyed / but thys kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of holy dayes (eſpecially of the Eaſter and Pentecoſt) are very auncient / and that theſe holy dayes for the remembrance of Martyrs / were vſed of long time. But theſe abuſes were no auncienter then other were / groſer alſo then thys was / as I haue before declared / and were eaſy further to be ſhewed / if nede required. And therefore I appeale from theſe examples to the ſcriptures / and to the examples of the perfecteſt church that euer was / whych was that in the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times. And yet alſo I haue to ſay / that the obſeruation of thoſe feaſtes firſt of all / was much better then of later times. For Socrates (confeſſing / that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> our ſauioure Chriſt nor the apoſtles / dyd decree or inſtitute any holy dayes / or lay any yoke of bondage vppon the neckes of thoſe whych came to the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching) addeth further / that they did vſe firſt to obſerue the holy dayes by cuſtom / and that as euery man was diſpoſed at home. Whych thing if it had remained in that freedome / that it was done by cuſtome / and not by commaundement / at the will of euery one / and not by conſtraint / it had bene much better then it is nowe / and had not drawne ſuche daungers vpon the poſteritye / as did after enſue / and we haue the experience of.</p>
               <p>As touching M. Bucers / M. Bullingers &amp; Illiricus allowance of them / if they meane ſuch a celebration of them / as that in thoſe dayes the people may be aſſembled and thoſe partes of the ſcriptures which concerne them whoſe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance is ſolemniſed / red / and expounded / and yet men not debarred after from their daily works / it is ſo much the les matter: if otherwiſe / that good leaue they giue the churches to diſſent from them in that poynt / I do take it graunted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me / being by the grace of God one of the churche.</p>
               <p>Althoughe as touching M. Bullenger it is to be obſerued / ſince the time that he wrote that vppon the Romaines / there are about .xxxv. yeares / ſythens whych time although he holde ſtill that the feaſtes dedicated vnto the Lord (as of the Natiuity / Eaſter / and Pentecoſt) may be kept / yet he denyeth flatly that it is lawfull to keepe holy the dayes of the apoſtles / as it appeareth in the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tigurine church ioyned wyth others. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>As for M. Caluine / as the practiſe of hym and the church where he lyued was and is / to admit no one holy day beſides the Lords day: ſo can it not be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed out of any parte of hys workes (as I thynke) that he approued thoſe holy dayes / whych are nowe in queſtion. He ſayeth in deede in hys Inſtitution: that he wil not condemne thoſe churches whych vſe them: No more do we the church of Englande / neyther in thys nor in other things / whych are meere to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For it is one thing to miſlike / another thyng to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne / and it is one thing to condemne ſome thing in the church / and an other thing to condemn the church
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21261:80"/> for it. And as for the places cited out of the epiſtles to the Galathians and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians / there is no mention of any holy dayes / eyther to ſaintes or to any other. And it appeareth alſo that he defendeth not other churches / but the church of Geneua / and anſweareth not to thoſe whych obiect againſt the keping of ſaintes dayes or any holy dayes (as they are called) beſides the Lords day / but againſt thoſe whych would not haue the Lords day kept ſtill / as a day of reſt from bode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labor / as it may appeare both by hys place vpon the Colloſſians / and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that whych is alleaged out of hys Inſtitutions. And that he meaneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing les then ſuche holy dayes / as you take vpon you to defende / it may appeare firſt in the place of the Coloſſians / where he ſayeth that the dayes of reſt whych are vſed of them / are vſed for pollicy ſake. Nowe it is well knowne / that as it is pollicy and a way to preſerue the eſtate of things / and to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and ſucces / that as well the beaſtes as the men whych labor ſixe dayes ſhould reſt the ſeuenth: ſo it tendeth to no pollicy nor wealth of the people or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of good order / that there ſhould be ſo many dayes / wherin men ſhould ceaſe from worke / being a thyng whych breedeth idleneſſe / and conſequently po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty / beſides other diſorders and vices / whych alwayes goe in company wyth idlenes. And in the place of hys Inſtitutions he declareth hym ſelfe yet more plainly / when he ſayeth / that thoſe odde holy dayes then are wythout ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / when they be ordained only for the obſeruing of diſcipline and order. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he geueth to vnderſtand / that he would haue them no further holy dayes / then for the time whych is beſtowed in the exerciſe of the diſcipline and order of the churche / and that for the reſt / they ſhoulde be altogither / as other dayes / free to be laboured in. And ſo it appeareth / that the holy dayes aſcribed to Saintes by the ſeruice booke / is a iuſt cauſe why a man can not ſafely without exception ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vnto the ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Nowe wheras maiſter Doctor ſayeth / it maketh no matter whether theſe things be taken out of the Portuis / ſo they be good. &amp;c. I haue proued firſt they are not good / then if they were / yet being not neceſſary / &amp; abuſed horribly by the papiſtes / other being as good / and better then they / ought not to remaine in the church. And as for Ambroſe ſaying all truthe of whome ſo euer it be ſayde / is of the holy ghoſte: it I were diſpoſed to moue queſtions / I coulde demaund of him whych careth not of whome he haue the truthe / ſo he haue it / what our ſauioure <note place="margin">Marke. 1. 24. Luke. 4. 41.</note> Chriſte meant to refuſe the teſtimony of Deuils / when they gaue a cleare teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that he was the ſonne of God / and the holy one: and what S.

Heere was truthe / and yet reiected / and I would knowe whether maiſter Doctor would ſay that theſe ſpake by the ſpirite of God. Thus whileſt wythout all iudgement he ſnatcheth heere a ſentence / and there another out of the Doctors / and that of the worſte / as if a man ſhould of purpoſe chuſe oute the droſſe / and leaue the ſiluer: wythin a while he wil make no great difference / not only betwene the prophets and apoſtles / and prophane wryters / as Ariſtotle and Plato / but not betweene them / whych ſpeake not by the conduite and leading of the holy ghoſt / but by the violent thruſting of the wicked ſpirite.</p>

               <p>WHereas vnto the Admonition prouing out of the thirde of S. Mathew / that preaching muſte goe before the myniſtring of the ſacramentes / you anſwere firſt / that it is agaynſt all Logicke to conclude a generall rule vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a particulare example: you ſhall vnderſtande that that which Iohn dyd in that poynt / he dyd it not as a ſingular perſon or as the ſonne of <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>acharie / but as the myniſter of the goſpell / and therefore it appertayneth as well to all other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as vnto hym. For as it is a good concluſion / that for ſo much as Peter in that he is a man / is borne to haue / and by common courſe of nature hath two legges / therefore Iohn and Thomas and all the reſt haue ſo: euen ſo for ſo much as Iohn by reaſon of hys miniſtery had neede firſt to preach / then to baptiſe / it followeth / that all others that haue that miniſtery committed vnto them muſt do the lyke. Secondarely you ſay / that it doth not appeare that he preached immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly before he baptiſed them with water. And yet S. Mathew after that he had ſhewed that he preached repentaunce (which the other Euangeliſtes call the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of repentance) he addeth that then the people were baptyſed of him / which alſo may appeare in the Actes / where S. Paule noteth thys order to haue bene <note place="margin">Act. 19. 5.</note> kept. For although betwene the ſtory of hys preaching and that which is ſayde of hys baptiſing / there is interlaced a deſcription of hys dyet and of hys apparel / yet theſe wordes (then came vnto hym. &amp;c.) muſt needes be referred vnto the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21261:83"/> tyme which followed hys preaching. And where as you ſay / that it is manyfeſt that our ſauiour Chriſt was baptyſed without preaching: I would know of you what one worde doth declare that / when as the contrary rather doth appeare in S. Luke / which ſeemeth to note playnly that our ſauiour Chriſt was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed / <note place="margin">3. Luk. 21.</note> when the people were baptyſed. But the people (as I haue ſhewed) were baptyſed immediatly after they heard Iohn preach / therefore it is lyke / that our ſauiour Chriſt was baptyſed / after that he had heard Iohn preach. And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable / that our ſauiour Chriſt which dyd honoure the myniſtery of God by the hand of men ſo farre / as he would voutchſafe to bee baptyſed of Iohn / would not neglect or paſſe by hys myniſtery of the word / being more precious then that of the ſacrament / as it appeareth by Iohn that our ſauiour Chriſt was preſent <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 26.</note> at hys ſermons / for ſo much as S. Iohn doth as he was preaching to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple poynt hym out with the finger / and told them that he was in the middeſt of them which was greater then he. And there is no doubt / but thoſe words which our ſauiour Chriſt ſayd before hys ſupper / although they are gathered by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes into ſhort ſentences / were notwithſtanding long ſermons / touching the fruite of hys death and vſe and ende of that ſacrament. And thys order of <note place="margin">Actes. 2. Act. 8. 12. 38. Act. 9. 17. 18. Act. 10. 34. Act. 16. 15. 33. Act. 20. 7.</note> preaching immedyatly before the myniſtring of the ſacramentes / is continually noted of S. Luke throughout the whole ſtory of the Actes of the Apoſtles. But I will not preciſely ſay neyther yet doe the authors of the Admonition affirme (as M. Doctor ſurmyſeth of them) that there muſt be preaching immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the admyniſtration of the ſacramentes. Thys I ſay / that when as the lyfe of the ſacramentes dependeth of the preaching of the worde of God / there muſt of neceſſitie the worde of God bee / not red but preached vnto the people / amongſte whom the ſacramentes are myniſtred. And foraſmuch as I haue proued before / that no man may myniſter the ſacramentes but he which is able to preache the word / although I dare not affirme / that there is an abſolute neceſſitie / that the word ſhould be preached immediatly before the ſacramentes be myniſtred / yet I can imagine no caſe / wherein it is eyther meete or conuenient or elſe almoſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable / that the ſacramentes ſhould be myniſtred without a ſermon before them / for the myniſter being as hee oughte of neceſſitie to bee / able to preache / oughte ſo to doe. And if it be ſayde that hys health or voyce will not ſerue hym ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes to preache / when he is able enough to myniſter the ſacramentes: I ſay that eyther he ought to begge the helpe of an other myniſter hard by / or elſe there is leſſe inconuenience in deferring the celebration of the ſacrament vntill hee bee ſtrong enough to preach / then miniſtring it ſo maymedly and without a ſermon / wherby it is ſene / how iuſt cauſe M.

               <p>After thys M.

For the authors of the Admonition declaring theyr vtter miſlyking that there ſhould be in ſtead of a preaching miniſter a reading myniſter (if I may ſo call hym) and in ſtead of preaching / reading / are vntruely expounded of M. doctor / as though they condemned all reading in the church. And heere he maketh hym ſelfe worke / &amp; picketh a quarell to blot a great deale of paper / &amp; to proue that which no man denyeth / for beſydes thys treatiſe he ſpeaketh afterward of it in halfe a ſcore pages / euen from the. 159. page vntill the. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21261:83"/> lighteth vs a candel at noone dayes. It is a token of a nature diſpoſed to no great quietneſſe / which rather then he would not ſtriue / ſtriueth with hym ſelfe. And although the cauſe be iuſt and good which he defendeth / yet I will note in a word or two / how as though there were pitch or ſome worſe thing in hys handes / hee defyleth whatſoeuer he toucheth. Firſt therefore he aſketh / and ſo / that he doth moſt boldly and confidently affirme it / whether the word of God is not as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual when it is red / as when it is preached / or whether reading be not preaching. In which two queſtions / although the one of them confuteth the other (for ſo much as if reading be preaching (as he ſayeth) then the comparyſon of the profite and efficacy betwene one and the other / is abſurde) yet I will anſwere to both. I ſay therefore that the word of God is not ſo effectuall red as preached. For S. Paule ſayth / that fayth commeth by hearing / &amp; hearing of the word preached / <note place="margin">10. Rom. 14.</note> ſo that the ordinary and eſpeciall meanes to worke fayth by / is preaching and not reading. And although reading doe helpe to nouriſh the fayth which commeth by preaching / yet thys is geuen to the preaching <hi>cath exochen,</hi> that is by excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy / and for that it is the excellenteſt and moſt ordinary meanes / to worke by / in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hartes of the hearers. The beholding of the creatures / &amp; the conſideration of the making of the world and of Gods wiſdome / and wonderfull loue appearing in them / doth nouriſh and ſtrengthen fayth / and yet may it not therefore in efficacy be compared to the preaching of the word of God. And to know that the worde of God preached / hath more force and is more effectuall then when it is red / it is to be obſerued whereunto the preaching is compared. It is called a lifting or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vp of our ſauiour Chriſt. Lyke vnto the diſplaying of a banner / as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 14.</note> was lift vp in the wildernes. As therefore that which is lyfted vp on hygh / is better and eaſelyer ſeene of a great company / then when it ſtandeth or lyeth vpon the grounde or in ſome valley or low place: ſo the preaching of the goſpell doth offer ſooner and eaſlyer the truth thereof vnto the fayth (which is the eye of the hearer) then when it is red. The ſame alſo may bee ſayde in that the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 15.</note> is called a cutting of the worde of God / for as when the meate is cut and ſhred / it nouriſheth more then when it is not ſo / ſo lykewyſe it is in preaching and reading. And that whiche is brought by the authors of the Admonition / and ſo ſcornefully hurled away of Maiſter Doctor / that S. Paule compareth <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 6.</note> the preaching vnto planting and watering / is a very notable place to proue that there is no ſaluation / without preaching. For as the huſbandman receyueth no frute / vnleſſe he both plant and water that which is planted: euen ſo there is no ſaluation to be looked for / where there is no preaching. And to thys alſo may bee well referred that the preaching is called of Saynt Luke an opening of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <note place="margin">24. Chap. 32.</note> whereby it is declared / that they be as it were ſhutte / or claſped / or ſealed vp vntill ſuch tyme as they bee by expoſition and declaration of them opened. It may bee that God doth ſometymes worke fayth by reading only / eſpecially wher preaching cannot bee / and ſo hee doth ſometymes without reading by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worke of hys ſpirite: but the ordinary wayes whereby God regenerateth hys children / is by the word of God / whiche is preached. And therfore Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon <note place="margin">Prou. 29. 18.</note> ſayeth / that where Propheſie (whiche is not a bare readyng / but an expoſytion and applycation of the ſcriptures) fayleth / there the people pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhe.

               <p>Of infinite examples take one of the Enuche / which although he had bene <note place="margin">Actes. 8.</note> at Ieruſalem / and returning home / was reading of the Prophet Eſay / yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued not / vntill Phillip came and preached vnto hym / which I neyther ſay to diſalow reading of the ſcripture (which is very profitable) nor yet to ſtrengthen the handes of the papiſtes / which to banyſhe the reading of the ſcriptures / obiect the hardneſſe and difficultie of the ſcriptures / as M. Doctor doth moſt ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly &amp; vnbrotherly ſurmiſe of the authors of the Admonition: but that it may appeare / what a groſe and a palpable error thys is / that the reading of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be as effectuall as the preaching of it / which God hath appoynted to be the eſpeciall and ſingulare meanes to ſaue thoſe / whome he hath appoynted to ſaluation. And what is thys elſe but to condemne the wiſdome of God in ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning paſtors and doctors to bee contynuall functions in the churches: and in ſo carefully commending them vnto the church of the which notwithſtanding there is no vſe / if reading be as good as preaching. And although thys be very groſe / yet in the. 163. page where he goeth about to ſhew the profite of reading the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the church / he is yet more abſurde. For there he ſayeth / that it may bee / that ſome men be more edifyed by the ſimple reading of the ſcriptures / then by ſermons. In deede if a man ſleepe the ſermon tyme / and wake the reading time / or be otherwyſe deafe at the one and attentife and heedye at the other / I will not deny / but he may be more edifyed at the ſimple reading / then at the ſermon / vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be in thys and ſuch lyke caſe / I know not how it may be tute that M. Doctor ſayth. And in deede it is as much to ſay that it may be / that the meanes that God hath ordayned to bee the fitteſt and meeteſt to call men to ſaluation / is not the fitteſt &amp; meeteſt meanes / which a man ſhould not once ſo much as thinke of / without trembling and ſhaking euery ioynte of hym. And now I thinke by thys tyme M. Doctor knoweth hys anſwere to hys ſecond queſtion / which is whether reading / be not preaching. And if this be not ſufficient that I haue ſaid / I would aſke gladly of hym / whether all readers be preachers / and whether whoſoeuer readeth / preacheth: for if it be true (which he ſayeth) that reading is preaching / then that is lykewyſe true / that all thoſe which read preach / and ſo a childe of 4. or 5. yeares olde / is able to preach / becauſe he is able to reade. And leaſt he ſhoulde ſeeme to be thus euill aduiſed without ſome reaſon / in the. 159. page he aſketh whether (if a man wryte hys ſermon / &amp; after reade it in the boke) that readyng be preaching. Heere is hard ſhift. What if I graunted that it is preaching / yet I deny that therefore he that readeth an other mans ſermon prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: and further I ſay / that if there be any ſuch / as being able to preach for his knowledge / yet for fault eyther of vtterance or memory can not do it but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng / that which he hath written: it is not conuenyent / that he ſhould be a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the church. For S. Paule doth not require only that the byſhop or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2.</note> ſhould be learned in the myſteries of the goſpell / &amp; ſuch a one as is able to ſet downe in wryting in hys ſtudy the ſenſe of the ſcripture / but one which is apt and fitte to teach. And the Prophet Malachie ſheweth / that he muſt haue the <note place="margin">Malach. 2. 7.</note> law not in hys papers / but in hys lippes / noting thereby / that it is neceſſary to haue the gift of vtteraunce / and Eſay the Prophet ſaying that God had geuen <note place="margin">Eſay. 50. 4.</note> hym the tonge of the learned / doth thereby declare / that it is not ſuffycient that he be well inſtructed in the myſtery of ſaluation / but that he haue alſo the gift of vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance. Afterwarde M. Doctor aſketh whether S. Paule dyd not preache to the Romaines when he wrote vnto them. No forſooth hys wryting to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines was no more preaching / then S. Paules hand or hys penne / which were hys inſtrumentes to wryte with / were hys tongue / or hys lyghtes / or any other partes / which were hys inſtrumentes to ſpeake with. And S. Paule hym ſelfe <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 15.</note>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:21261:84"/> wryting to the Romaines / putteth a difference betwene hys wryting &amp; hys prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching / when although he wrote vnto them / yet he excuſeth hym ſelfe that he could not come to preach vnto them / ſaying that he was ready as much as lay in hym to preach vnto them. But ſayeth he / was not the reading of Deuteronomie preaching? No more then the reading of Erodus. Heere be good proufes. It is generally denyed / that reading is preaching / and Mayſter Doctoure without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proufe / taketh it for graunted / that the reading of Deuteronomie is preaching. All men ſee / how pityfull reaſons theſe be. And in the. 162. page he alledgeth that in the Actes S. Luke ſeemeth to meane by reading preaching. But what dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">Cap. 15. 21.</note> is thys / vpon a ſeeming and coniecture / to ſet down ſo certenly and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly / that reading is preaching / &amp; then there is no one letter nor ſillable that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth any ſuch coniecture. For S. Iames ſayth that Moyſes (meaning the law) red euery Saboth through out euery towne in the ſinagogue / was alſo prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched / or had thoſe that preached it / ſetting forth the order which was vſed in all the churches amongſt the people of God: that alwayes when they met vpon the Saboth dayes / they had the ſcriptures firſt redde / and then preached of and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded / which is that the authors of the Admonition doe deſire / and therefore complayne for that after reading followeth no preaching / which any indifferent man may eaſely vnderſtand by that that they ſay: In the olde tyme the worde was preached / now it is ſuppoſed to be ſufficient if it be red.</p>
               <p>But Mayſter Doctor heareth with hys left eare / and readeth with hys left eye / as though hys right eye were pulled out / or hys ryght care cut of. For otherwyſe the other wordes which they haue touching thys matter / myght eaſely haue bene expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; matter which they handle. Of myniſtring of the ſacramentes in priuate places &amp; by women / I haue ſpoken before / there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth therefore only in thys ſection / to ſpeake of the deacons / that they ought not to miniſter the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Which although I haue done partly before / &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afterward will do / when I ſhall ſhew that it appertayneth not to them to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the worde / and therefore not the ſacramentes (being things the myniſtery whereof ought not to be ſeuered) yet I will in a worde anſwere thoſe arguments that M. Doctor bryngeth for to proue that they may myniſter the ſacramentes. Whereof the fyrſt is / that Phillip in the. 8. of the Acts baptyſed. There is great doubt amongſt wryters / which Phillip that was that S. Luke mentioneth in <note place="margin">Actes. 15. 21.</note> the eyght chapter of the Acts of the Apoſtles: But I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him to be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Phillip / that was the deacon &amp; anſweare that he was no deacon then. For the church of Ieruſalem whereof he was deacon / being ſcattered / he could be no more deacon of it / or diſtribute the money that was collected for the poore of the church. And further I anſweare that he was afterwarde an Euangeliſt / and therefore prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not by vertue of hys deaconſhyppe (whoſe calling is not to preache) but by that he was an Euangeliſt / whoſe office put vpon hym a neceſſitie of preaching. After you ſay that deacons are not permitted with vs to celebrate the Lordes ſupper / and why then ſhoulde they be ſuffered to myniſter baptiſme? as if the one ſacrament were not as precious as the other. Thys is a myſerable rending a ſonder of thoſe things / which God hath ioyned together / not only to ſeperate the myniſtery of the ſacramentes from the word / but alſo the myniſtery of one ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from an other.</p>
               <p>And what reaſon is there / that it ſhould be graunted vnto one that can not preach being (as they call hym a myniſter) to myniſter both the ſacramentes / whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the ſame is not permitted vnto a deacon (as they call hym) which is able to preach? I doe not ſpeake it for that I woulde haue thoſe which be deacons in deede / that is which haue charge to prouide for the poore of ſome one congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / eyther preach or myniſter the ſacraments: but I ſay that it is agaynſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon / to permit the myniſtery of the ſacramentes to thoſe which can not preach / &amp;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21261:85"/> to deny it to thoſe which are able to preach. In the. 118. page vnto the example of Phillip / he addeth S. Stephen / which was one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deacons which he affirmeth to haue preached. But I deny it / for all that long oration which he hath in the 7. of the Actes / is no ſermon / but a defence of hym ſelfe agaynſt thoſe accuſations / which were layde agaynſt hym / as M. Beza doth very learnedly &amp; ſubſtancially proue in hys annotations vpon thoſe places of S. Stephens diſputations &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Now to defend hym ſelfe being accuſed / is lawfull not for the deacons only / but for any other chriſtian / &amp; we read nothing that Stephen dyd there eyther tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the defence of hys cauſe / or the ſharpe rebuking of the obſtinate phariſeys and prieſtes / but that the holy Martyrs of God which were no deacons nor my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters / haue done with vs / when they haue bene conuented before their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And where as he ſayth that Philip baptiſed / I haue ſhewed before by what authoritie he dyd it / that is / not in that he was a deacon / but for that he was an Euangeliſt. He addeth further out of Iuſtin Martyr / that the deacons dyd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute the bread &amp; the wyne in the admyniſtration of the ſupper. Tullie ſayth in a certayne place that it is as great a poynt of wyſedome in an aduocate or pleader of cauſes / to holde backe and to keepe cloſe that which is hurtfull to hys cauſe / as it is to ſpeake that which is profitable.</p>
               <p>M. Doctor obſerueth none of theſe poyntes / for beſydes that the thinges which he brought for the defence of the ſeruice booke / are ſuch / as they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeared: in ſeeking to defende it / he manyfeſtly oppugneth it. For before he ſayde that the booke of ſeruice doth not permit deacons to myniſter the ſupper of the Lord / and that by way of alowing of the booke: and here he proueth that the deacons dyd myniſter the ſacrament of the ſupper / and that alſo as a thing which he doth alow of.</p>
               <p>But to let that paſſe / I beſeech thee (good Reader) marke / what a myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of the ſupper thys is which Iuſtin maketh mention of / &amp; note with what conſcience M. Doctor handeleth this cauſe. Iuſtin ſaith that after the ſcriptures are red and preached of / and prayers made / bread and wine &amp; water was brought forth / and that the myniſter made prayers and thankes geuing in the hearing of the people (which is that which the Euangeliſtes call the bleſſing / and hath bene of later tymes called the conſecration) and after that the people were partakers of them / that then thys being done / the deacons dyd cary of that which was left / vnto thoſe which were not preſent (for that corruption of ſending the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vnto the houſes was then in the churche / agaynſt which I haue before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) now if to cary to a priuate houſe the breade and wyne which was bleſſed or ſet a part by prayers / &amp; by obeying the inſtitution of Chriſt by the myniſter / be to myniſter the ſacrament of the ſupper / then Serapions boye / of whome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made by Euſebius / myniſtred the ſacrament. For Serapion being ſicke as I haue before ſhewed / and ſending hys boye to the myniſter for the ſacrament / receiued the ſame at the handes of hys boye / for that the myniſter being ſicke / could not come hym ſelfe: ſo by M. Doctors reaſon / Serapions boye myniſtred <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>l.</hi> 43.</note> the ſacrament. And a man would not thinke that one that hath bene the Quenes Maieſties publike profeſſor of diuinitie in Cambridge / ſhould not know to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh &amp; put a difference betwene myniſtring the ſacrament / &amp; helping to diſtribute the bread and the cup of the ſacrament. And if M. Doctor could not learne thys in bokes / yet he might haue eyther ſene it / or at leaſt heard tell of it in all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med churches almoſt / where the Deacons doe aſſiſt the myniſter in helping of hym to diſtribute the cuppe / and in ſome places alſo the bread / for the quicker and ſpedyer diſpatch of the people / being ſo many in number / that if they ſhould all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the bread and the cuppe at the myniſters hand / they ſhould not make an end in eight houres / which by that aſſiſtance may be finiſhed in two / which is tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that M. Caluin ſayth. For he ſayth the Deacons dyd reach the cup / &amp; maketh no
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21261:85"/> mention of the bread. And if thys be to myniſter the ſacrament / then they that cut the loafe in peeces / they that fetch the wine for the ſupper / they that poure it forth from greater veſſels into glaſſes and cuppes / or whoſoeuer aydeth any thing in thys action / doe myniſter the ſacrament: then the which thing there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ridyculous.</p>
               <p>In the ende M. Doctor to ſhut vp thys matter / ſayth / that it is the firſt ſteppe to the myniſtery / and ſo ioyned of S. Paule in the third chapter and firſt Epiſtle to Timothe. But what a reaſon is thys: to be a Deacon is the firſt ſtep to the myniſtery / therefore the Deacon may preach and myniſter the ſacraments / when as the contrary rather followeth. For if it be a ſtep to the myniſtery / then it is not the myniſtery / but differeth from it / and ſo ought not to doe the things that belong to the myniſter. But I deny that it is / or ought to be alwayes a ſteppe to the myniſtery. I knew that it hath bene the vſe of long tyme / &amp; I know alſo that there be very many which interpreate the place of S. Paule / (where he ſpeaking of the Deacons that behaue them ſelues well / that they get them ſelues a good <hi>bathmon,</hi> that is a degree to be a myniſter or a byſhop.) But I will ſhew a manifeſt reaſon / why it can not ſo be vnderſtanded / which is / for that as the functions of a Deacon or a myniſter are dyuers: ſo are the giftes alſo wherby thoſe functions are executed likewyſe dyuers. And therefore there may be ſome men for their wiſedome and grauitie / diſcretion and faythfulneſſe / and whatſoeuer other giftes are required in hym / that ſhoulde doe thys office of prouyding for the poore / and to be a good Deacon: which notwithſtanding for ſome impediment in hys tongue / or for want of vtterance ſhall neuer be able as long as he lyueth / to be a good myniſter of the word / and therefore the giftes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dyuers wherewith thoſe offices muſt be executed / (although it is neyther vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull / nor vnmeete to make of a Deacon a myniſter if he haue giftes for that purpoſe) yet I deny that S. Paule appoynteth that the Deaconſhip ſhoulde be (as it were) the ſeede or frie of the myniſters: or that he meaneth by thoſe words that the Deaconſhip is a ſteppe to the paſtorſhyp. Which may yet alſo further appeare / by the phraſe of ſpeach which the Apoſtle vſeth. For he doth not ſay that they that do the office of Deaconſhip well / ſhall come to or get a good ſtanding / but he ſayth that in ſo doing they doe gette themſelues a good ſtanding / that is they get themſelues authoritie &amp; eſtimation in the church / whereby they may be both the bolder to doe their office / and whereby they may doe it with more frute. Whereas when they liue naughtely / they neyther dare doe oftentimes that which they ſhould doe / nor yet that which they doe well / taketh ſo good effect / becauſe of the diſcredite which commeth by their euill behauiour. And ſo I conclude that M. Doctor hath brought hetherto nothing / to proue why either Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ought / or elſe haue wont eyther to preach or to myniſter the ſacramentes.</p>
               <p>And albeit M. Doctor be not able to ſhew it / yet I confes that it hath bene in tymes paſt permitted vnto them in ſome churches to baptiſe / in other ſome to preach and baptiſe and ſometymes alſo to myniſter the ſupper: but I ſay alſo that thys was a corruption / and vſed at thoſe tymes / when there were many other groſe &amp; vntollerable abuſes / from the which I doe appeale vnto that which was firſt / that is the inſtitution of the Apoſtles / which lymitted and bounded euery function within hys ſeuerall limites and borders which it ought not to paſſe.</p>

For thys is that they alledge to proue theyr vnwritten verityes / when as it is eaſely anſweared both to the papiſtes and M.

               <p>MAiſter Doctor aſketh how it is proued that there was any examination of the communicantes. After thys ſorte: all thinges neceſſarye were vſed in the churches of God in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles times / but examynation of thoſe whoſe knowledge of the miſtery of the goſpell was not knowne or doubted of / was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thing / therfore it was vſed in the churches of God which were in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tyme. Then he ſayeth he is ſure there is neither commaundement nor exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all the ſcripture. In the booke of the Chronicles he might haue red / that <note place="margin">2. Chro. 35. 6.</note> the Leuites were there commaunded to prepare the people vnto the receyuing of the paſſeouer / in place whereof we haue the Lordes ſupper. Now examination being a part of the preparation / it followeth that heere is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. And how holdeth thys argument / S. Paule commaundeth that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſhould proue hym ſelfe / <hi>Ergo</hi> there is no commaundement that the myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould proue and examine them? ſo I may ſay that euery man is a ſpirituall king to gouerne hym ſelfe / therefore he may not be gouerned of others. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 9.</note> of the Admonition doe not meane that euery one ſhoulde be examyned as thoſe whoſe vnderſtanding in the goſpell is well knowen / or which doe examyne them ſelues / and ſo they interpreate them ſelues in the. 108. page.</p>

               <p>I Haue ſpoken of thys bread before in generall / and if Maiſter Doctor dyd not diſagree wyth hym ſelfe / we are heere well agreed. For firſt he ſayth it ſkilleth not what bread we haue / and by and by he ſayth / that he wyſheth it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread / and aſſigneth a great cauſe which the booke of ſeruice lykewiſe aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth / which is to auoyde ſuperſtition. And it is certaynely known by experience / that in dyuers places the ignoraunt people y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> haue beene myſled in popery / haue knocked and kneeled vnto it / and helde vp theyr handes / whileſt the myniſter hath geuen it / not thoſe only which haue receyued it / but thoſe which haue bene in the churche / and looked on. I ſpeake of that whiche I knowe / and haue ſene wyth my eyes. An other reaſon is alleaged by Mayſter Bucer / which is / that there being ſome thicker ſubſtance of breade / and ſuch as ſhould moue and ſtirre vp the taſt better / the conſyderation of the mynde which is conueyed by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes / might be alſo the more effectuall / and ſo the fruite of receyuing greater. By the way note that eyther Bucers cenſures vppon the booke of ſeruice be falſely aſcribed vnto hym / or be corrupted / or elſe were not euen in hys owne tyme heere
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21261:86"/> thought good / ſubſtantiall / and ſuffycient / when there is ſome cauſe by Acte of Parliament afterwarde found (I meane in the ſecond booke of kyng Edward) to miſlyke wafer cakes / and to chaunge them into common bread. How ſo euer it be / that circumſtance would be well marked / that it was one thyng to talke of a wafer cake in the vſe of the ſupper in kyng Edward dayes before they were iuſtly abolyſhed / &amp; an other thyng now being reuoked after they were remoued.</p>
               <p>Beſides that / we be called by the example of our ſauioure Chriſte to vſe in the ſupper vſuall and common bread / for what time our ſauioure Chriſt celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hys ſupper / there was no other breade to be gotten / but vnleauened breade / there being a ſtraight charge geuen by the lawe / that there ſhould be then no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened bread. And it is not to be doubted / but that if there had bene then when he celebrated hys ſupper as at other times nothyng but leauened breade / he woulde not haue cauſed vnleauened bread to haue bene made for that purpoſe of celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hys ſupper. But thys is a groſſe ouerſyght of M. Doctor / both in thys ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / and that whych goeth before / that he hathe not learned to make a difference betwene that whych is not ſincerely done / and that whych is not at all done. For in the former ſection he triumpheth vpon the admonition / becauſe they conclude / that for as muche as there is no examination / therefore it is not rightly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely miniſtred. For ſayeth he / the examination of the communicants / is not of the ſubſtance of the ſacrament / and in thys ſection he ſayeth / that for as muche as it is not of the ſubſtance of the ſacrament / whether there be leauened or vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread / therfore it is not ſufficiently proued / that the ſacrament is not ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſtred. But he ought to haue vnderſtanded / that if either the matter of the ſacrament as bread and wine / or the forme of it / whych is the inſtitution (whych thyngs are only ſubſtantiall partes) were wanting / that then there ſhould haue bene no ſacrament miniſtred at all / but they being retayned / and yet other things vſed / whych are not conuenient / the Sacrament is miniſtred / but not ſincerely. For example in the popiſhe baptiſme / there was the ſubſtance of baptiſme / but there being vſed ſpyttle and creame / and candels / and ſuch beggerly trumpery / it was not ſincerely miniſtred / therefore it is one thyng to miniſter ſincerely / and an other thyng to miniſter / ſo that that whych is of the ſubſtance ſhoulde be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But of thys diſtinction I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in an other place / wherinto although M. doctor falleth in the next ſection / and in other places / yet thys ſhall be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for all.</p>
               <p>The meaning of the Admonition in ſaying (their God of the altar) is plain enough / that it is vnderſtanded of the papiſts / but that M. Doctor doth ſet him ſelfe to draw the authors of it into hatred: and he can not be ignorant / that when a man ſpeaketh of thyngs whych are notoriouſly knowne / he often vſeth (the or that / or their) wythout naming the thyngs whych he ſpeaketh of.</p>

               <p>ALthough it be not of neceſſity / that we ſhuld receyue the communion ſitting / yet there is the ſame cauſe of abolyſhing kneeling / that there is of remouing the wafer cake / and if there be danger of ſuperſtition in one (as M. Doctor confeſſeth) why is there not danger in the other? And if there be men that take occaſion to fall at the one / and that by ſuperſtition / howe commeth it to paſſe that M. Doctor in the. 180. page / ſayeth that neyther goſpeller / nor papiſtes obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate nor ſimple / can ſuperſtitiouſly offend in this kneelyng / when as the kneeling caryeth a greater ſhewe of worſhyp / and Imprinteth in the mindes of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a ſtronger opinion and a deeper print of adoration / then the ſyght of a rounde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21261:87"/> howe came it to paſſe / that in King Edwardes dayes / there was a proteſtation added in the boke of prayer / to cleare that geſture from adoration.</p>
               <p>An other reaſon why kneeling ſhould be taken away / is for that ſitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth better wyth the action of the ſupper / whervnto M. Doctor taketh excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / bothe in thys place / and where he ſpeaketh againe of it / that for ſo much as thys ſacrament is a ſacrament of thankes geuing / and thankes geuing a prayer / therfore kneeling to be moſt fit / as that whych we vſe ordinarily when we pray.</p>
               <p>But he ſhuld haue remembred / that that thanks geuing may wel come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we haue receyued the ſacrament / and that whileſt we receyue the bread and wine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t / we are not then moſt fit to ſpeake / they being in our mouths, and during the time we receyue them / our minde is occupied in conſydering the ineſtimable benefite whych the Lorde hathe beſtowed vpon vs / and to meditate of the frute whych we receiue thereby / by the Analogie and compariſon betwene the bodely nouriſhment and the ſpirituall / that by theſe conſiderations our minds may be more enflamed and ſette on fire / and our mouthes may be filled wyth the praiſe of God / after we haue receyued. And further if thys be a good reaſon that therefore it is meete we ſhoulde kneele at the ſupper for as muche as we geue thanks / then it foloweth that when ſo euer we haue ſupped or dined / it is meete that we ſhould kneele / when as yet we do ſay grace ſitting. And by thys he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our ſauioure Chriſte and hys Apoſtles / as thoſe whych did not vſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whych was moſt fitte: for in hys iudgement he ſayeth kneeling is the fitteſt ſite or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body which can be / and if our ſauioure Chriſt had bene of that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / vndoubtedly he wold haue alſo kneeled / and cauſed hys Apoſtles ſo to do. In the. 181. page vnto the admonition / ſaying that ſitting is moſt fitte / becauſe it betokeneth reſt and accompliſhment of the ceremonies in our ſauioure Chriſte / M. doctor ſayth it is a papiſticall reaſon / and triumpheth ouer the authors of the admonition / becauſe they allegory / when as notwythſtanding the ſurplice before / croſſing / and rings. &amp;c. afterwards / are defended by nothing / but wyth vain alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories / whych haue nothing ſo good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds as thys hath. But let it be that thys is not ſo ſound a reaſon (as in deede for my part I wil not defend it / and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors them ſelues haue corrected it) yet M. doctor might haue dealt eaſlier with all / then to callit a papiſticall reaſon / which is far from popery / and the reaſon of two notable learned &amp; zealous men Iohannes Alaſco / and of M.

               <p>IF the place of the. 5. to the Corinths do forbid that we ſhould haue any fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity wyth notorious offenders / it doth much more forbid that they ſhould be receyued to the communion. And therfore papiſts being ſuch / as which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly knowne to hold hereticall opinions / ought not to be admitted / much les compelled to the ſupper. For ſeeing that our ſauioure Chriſte did inſtitute hys ſupper amongſt hys diſciples / and thoſe only whych were as S. Paule ſpeaketh wythin / it is euident / that the papiſtes being wythout / and foreiners and ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the church of God / ought not to be receiued / if they woulde offer them ſelues: and that miniſter that ſhall geue the ſupper of the Lord to hym whych is knowne to be a papiſt / and whych hath neuer made any cleare renouncing of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery with which he hath ben defiled / doth prophane the table of the Lord / &amp; doth geue the meat that is prepared for the children / to dogges / and he bryngeth into the paſture whych is prouided for the ſheepe / ſwine and vncleane beaſts / contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the faith and truſt that ought to be in a ſtewarde of the Lordes houſe / as he is. For albeit that I doubt not / but many of thoſe whych are now papiſts / per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the election of God / whych God alſo in hys good time will call to the knowledge of hys truthe: yet notwythſtanding they ought to be vnto the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and vnto the church touching the miniſtring of the ſacramentes / as ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and as vncleane beaſtes. And as for the papiſts / howſoeuer they receiue it / whether as their popiſh breaden God (as ſome doe) or as common and ordinary bread (as other ſome do) or as a thing they know not what (as ſome other) they do nothing els but eat and drinke their owne condemnation / the waight wherof they ſhall one day aſſuredly feele / vnles they do repeat them of ſuch horrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of the Lords moſt holy myſteries. And if thys be to gratify the papiſts / to ſhewe that they ought not to be compelled to receiue the ſupper of the Lorde / as long as they continue in their popery: I am well content to ſhewe them thys. pleaſure / ſo that bothe they and you forget not / what I haue before ſayd / that the magiſtrate ought to compell them to heare the worde of God / and if they profite not / nor wyth ſufficient teaching correcte not them ſelues / that then they ſhoulde be punyſhed. And if you doe aſke whye they ſhoulde be more compelled vnto the ſermons / then vnto the ſupper of the Lorde / or why they are not as well to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto the one / as vnto the other: you ſee the like done in the ſacrament of baptiſme / whych may not be miniſtred vnto all to whome the word may be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. The reaſon alſo is at hand / for the preaching of the worde of God to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes / is an offer of the grace of God / whych may be made to thoſe whych are ſtrangers from God / but the miniſtring of the holy ſacraments vnto them / is a declaration and ſeale of Gods fauor &amp; reconciliation with them / and a plain prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching / partly that they be waſhed already from their ſinnes / partly that they are of the houſhold of God / and ſuch as the Lord will feede to eternail lyfe / whych is not lawful to be don to thoſe whych are not of the houſhold of fayth. And therfore. I conclude / that the compelling of papiſts vnto the communion / and the diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and letting of them go / whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they be to be punyſhed for their ſtubbernes in popery (wyth thys condition if they will receiue the communion) is very vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful / when as although they wold receyue it / yet they ought to be kept back / vntil ſuch time / as by their religious and goſpellike behauior / they haue purged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21261:88"/> of that ſuſpition of popery / whych their former life and conuerſation hath cauſed to be conceyued. As for the fee that M. doctor ſayeth we be worthy of / for ſhewing our ſelues (as he ſayth) ſo good patrones of the papiſtes / he hath geuen vs well to vnderſtande / what it ſhould be if he were the paymaiſter: but as we ſerue the Lord in thys worke / ſo we loke for rewarde at hys hande / not fearing but that the Lord will in the ende geue ſuch bleſſing vnto our labors / as we ſhal not neede greatly to feare at the hands of thoſe whych God hath placed in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity / thereward whych you do ſo often call for.</p>

But it can be no more preciſely ſayd that it hath fayth / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it may be ſayd preciſely elected (for in dede it is all one to ſay that it is elect / and to ſay it beleueth) and this I thinke the authors of the admonition do meane / when they ſay that they require a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Godfather / whych is not in them to performe. Thirdly / if bothe thoſe thyngs were true / that is / that infantes had fayth / and that it myght be preciſely ſayd y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it beleeueth / yet ought not the miniſter demaund thys of the childe / whom he knoweth can not anſwer hym / nor thoſe that anſwer for the childe ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund to be baptiſed / when they neyther meane / nor may be (being already bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed. But it is meete / that all thyngs ſhould be done grauely / ſimply / and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the church. And ſo (if thoſe other two thyngs were lawfull) it ought to be done / as ſeemeth to haue bene done in S. Auguſtines times / when the miniſter aſked thoſe that preſented the infant / and not the infant / whether it were fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full / and thoſe whych preſented / anſweared in their owne perſons / and not in the childes / that it was faythfull.</p>

               <p> For Godfathers there is no controuerſy betwene the admonition / and M. doctors boke / whych appeareth not only in their corrections / but plainly in the 188. page / where they declare that they rather condemne the abuſe / whyleſt it is vrged more then greater matters / and whych are in deede neceſſary / thys being a thyng arbitrarie / and left to the diſcretion of the church / and whileſt there is ſo euil choyſe for the moſte parte of Godfathers / whych is expreſſedly mentioned of the admonition / and whileſt it is vſed almoſt for nothyng elſe / but as a meane for one frende to gratify an other / wythout hauing any regarde to the ſolempne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe made before God and the congregation / of ſeeing the childe broughte vp in the nurture and feare of the Lord. For the thyng it ſelfe / conſydering that it is ſo generally receyued of all the churches / they do not miſlike of it.</p>
               <p>As for fonts I haue ſpoken of before / both particularly &amp; in general. But wheras M. doctor ſayeth in the apoſtles times they baptiſed in no baſins but in riuers &amp; common waters / I wold know whether there was a riuer or common water in Cornelius and in the iaylors houſes / where Paul and Peter baptiſed.</p>
               <p>To proue croſſing in baptiſme / M. Bucers authority is brought. I haue ſayd before / what iniury it is to leaue the publyke workes of Bucer / and to flye vnto the <hi>Apochryphas,</hi> wherin alſo they might driue vs to vſe the like / and to ſet downe lykewiſe hys wordes whych we finde in hys priuate letters. But it is firſt of all to be obſerued of the reader / howe &amp; wyth what name thoſe notes are called / whych are cited of M. Doctor for the defence of theſe corruptions. They are called by M. Doctors owne confeſſion (cenſures) which word ſignifyeth and implyeth / as muche as corrections and controlments of the booke of ſeruice / and therefore we may take thys for a generall rule throughout the whole boke of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice / that in whatſoeuer thyngs in controuerſy M. Doctor doth not bring Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers authority to confirme them / that thoſe thyngs Bucer miſlyked of: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in priuate baptiſme / and communions miniſtred in houſes / for interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories miniſtred vnto infants / &amp; ſuch lyke / for ſo much as they are not confirmed here by M. Bucers iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t / it may be thought / that he miſlyked of them / and no doubt if eyther M. Bucers notes had not eyther condemned or miſlyked of diuers thyngs in the ſeruice boke: we ſhould haue had the notes printed and ſet forthe to the full / thys I thought in a word to admoniſhe the reader of.</p>
               <p>Vnto M. Bucers authority / I could heere oppoſemen of as great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity / yea the authoritye of all the reformed churches / whych ſhall alſo be done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. And if there were nothyng to oppoſe but the worde of God / whych will haue the ſacraments miniſtred ſimply / and in that ſincerity that they be left vnto vs / it is enoughe to make all men to couer their faces / and to be aſhamed / if that whych they ſhall ſpeake / be not agreeable to that ſimplicity. The reaſons whych Bucer bryngeth I will anſwer / whych in thys matter of croſſing are two. Firſt that it is auncient / and ſo it is in deede. For Tertullian maketh mention of thys <note place="margin">Lib. de reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. carnis.</note> vſage / and if thys be ſufficient to proue the goodneſſe of it / then there is no cauſe why we ſhould miſlyke of the other ſuperſtitions and corruptious whych were likewyſe vſed in thoſe tunes. For the ſame Tertullian ſheweth / that they vſed <note place="margin">Lib. de corona militis.</note> alſo at baptiſme to taſte of miike and hony / and not to waſhe all the weeke after they had miniſtred baptiſme.</p>
               <p>But heere I will note the cauſe whervpon I ſuppoſe thys vſe of croſſing came vp in the primitiue church / wherby ſhal appeare / how there is no cauſe now why it ſhuld be retained / if there were any why it ſhould be vſed in the primitiue church. It is knowne to all that haue red the Eccleſiaſtical ſtories / that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then dyd obiect to the Chriſtians in times paſt in reproche / that the God whych they beleued of / was hanged vpon a croſſe. And they thought good to teſtify that they were not aſhamed therefore of the ſame God / by the often vſing of the ſigne of the croſſe / whych carefulnes and good minde to keepe amongſt them an open
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21261:89"/> profeſſion of Chriſte crucifyed / althoughe it be to be commended: yet is not thys meanes ſo: for they myght otherwyſe haue kept it / and wyth les daunger / then by thys vſe of croſſing. And if they thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of the croſſe to be the beſt meanes / yet they ſhould not haue bene ſo bolde / as to haue brought it into the holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of baptiſme / and ſo mingle the ceremonies and inuentions of men / wyth the ſacraments &amp; inſtitution of God. And as it was brought in vpon no good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d / ſo the Lord left a marke of hys curſſe of it / and wherby it myght be perceyued to come out of the forge of mannes braine / in that it began forthwyth / while it was yet in the ſwadling clouts to be ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed. For it appeareth by Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian alſo in the ſame booke <hi>De corona militis,</hi> that the chriſtians had ſuch a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition in it / that they would doe nothyng / nor take nothyng in hande / vnles they had croſſed them when they went out / when they came in / when they ſate or lay downe / and when they roſe / and as ſuperſtition is alwayes ſtrengthened / and ſpreadeth it ſelfe wyth the time / ſo it came from croſſing of men / vnto croſſing of euery thyng that they vſed. Whervpon Chryſoſtome comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the croſſing <note place="margin">Vpon the. 1. of Tim. 4. chap.</note> of the cup before a man drynke / and of the meate before it was eaten. But if it were graunted that vpon thys conſyderation whych I haue before mentioned / the auncient chriſtians dyd well: yet it foloweth not / that we ſhould ſo doe. For we lyue not amongſt thoſe nations whych do caſt vs in the teethe / or reproche vs wyth the croſſe of Chriſte. If we liued amongſt the Turkes / it were another matter / and then there myght peraduenture ſome queſtion be / whether we ſhuld do as they dyd / and hauyng the ſame ſore / vſe the ſame playſter: but now we liue among the papiſtes / that do not contemne the croſſe of Chriſt / but whych eſteme more of the wodden croſſe / then of the true croſſe of Chriſt (whych is hys ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings) we ought now do cleane contrarywiſe to the olde chriſtians / and abolyſhe all vſe of theſe croſſes / for contrary dyſeaſes muſt haue contrary remedyes. If therfore the olde chriſtians to delyuer the croſſe of Chriſt from contempt / dyd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vſe the croſſe: the chriſtians now to take away the ſuperſtitious eſtimation of it / ought to take away the vſe of it. Concerning the other reaſon of the profitable ſignification of the croſſe / I haue ſhewed / that that maketh the thyng a greate deale worſe / and bryngeth in a newe worde into the church / wheras there ought to be no Doctor heard in the church / but only our ſauioure Chriſt. For if theſe ſignifications be good / then the papiſts haue to anſwer vs / that their ceremonies be not dumbe / whych haue as lykely and as gloryous ſignifications as theſe are / and ſo in deede they ſay / that their ceremonyes are not dumbe ceremonyes / for ſo much as they ſignify ſo good thyngs. But although it be the worde of God that we ſhould not be aſhamed of the croſſe of Chriſte / yet is it not the word of God / that we ſhould be kept in remembrance and obſeruation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> by two lines drawn a croſſe one ouer an other in the childes forehead / but a fond toy and idle deuiſe of mannes brayne.</p>
               <p>In the. 192. page / vnto the admonition obiecting that by thys ſignification it is made a ſacrament / M. Doctor anſweareth that euery ceremony whych be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth ſome thyng is not a ſacrament: I would knowe what maketh a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if a doctrine annexed vnto an outwarde ſigne dothe not make a ſacrament. And I am ſure / there was no outward ſigne neyther in the olde teſtament nor in the newe / whych hath a doctrine ioyned wyth it / whych is not a ſacrament. For if he will take the nature of the ſacrament ſo ſtraightly as Auguſtine dothe / and that there be no Sacramentes / but when as to the clement there commeth the worde / the circumciſion can be no ſacrament. Beſydes that / ſeeing that mayſter Doctor hath condemned the allegorie and ſignifycation of ſytting at the Lordes ſupper / ſaying that it is Papiſticall / I maruell what priuiledge he hath or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all lycence / that he may allow that in hym ſelfe and in hys owne aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / whych he ſayeth is vnlawfull and papiſticall in others / eſpecially ſeeing the allegorye of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21261:90"/> the ſitting was neuer vſed by the Papiſtes / but thys of croſſing is. And if thys licence of allegories be alowed / I ſee not why Oyle may not be brought into the ſacrament / as well as croſſing / bothe becauſe it hath bene a ſacrament of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore / and for that the ſignification therof (betokening the gifts of the holy ghoſt / and ſhadowing out the power &amp; efficacie of thoſe gyfts) caryeth as great a ſhew of wiſedome and chriſtian inſtruction / as doth the croſſing. And to conclude / I ſee no cauſe / why ſome croſſes ſhuld be vnlawfull / and other ſome commendable: and why it ſhould be a monument of popery in wode and metal / and yet a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian badge in the forehead of a man: why we ſhould not lyke of it in ſtreates and hygh wayes / &amp; yet allow of it in the church. And becauſe I would haue all thoſe thyngs together / that touche thys matter of baptiſme / I come to that whych he hath in the next ſection / &amp; in the. 111. page / where after hys old manner he wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth and quarelleth. For although the Admonition ſpeaketh ſo plainly and ſo clearely / that (as <hi>Heſiode</hi> ſayth) it myght <hi>areskein to momo</hi> ſatiſfy Momus / yet M. doctor goeth about there to bryng it in ſuſpition of Anabaptiſme / becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in playne words / the baptiſme of infants / they adde that if the parties be of diſcretion and yeres / them ſelues in their owne parſons ſhould demaund to be baptiſed. For ſayeth he in this church / they tary not for baptiſme ſo long. But is there no caſe or may there not be / when they that be of age may be baptiſed? It may be there are Iewes in England / whych vnderſtanding their blindnes / and confeſſing their ſynne / may deſire to be baptiſed / and there be diuers Mores in noble mennes and gentle mennes houſes / whych are ſometimes brought to the knowledge of Chriſt / wherby there is ſome vſe and practiſe of thys caſe.</p>
               <p>After that M. Doctor hath caſt hym ſelfe in deriſion / at the feete of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Admonition / and deſired to be taught of them whom he hath ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly condemned as vnlearned / he dothe by and by raiſe vp hym ſelfe into hys chaire / and there ſitteth Doctorally / appoſing the authors of the admonition / as if they were hys ſchollers: and vpon occaſion of the ſound fayth and good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauyor of the parents of the infante mentioned by the admonition / aſketh firſt of all / what if the infant be the childe of a dronkard? what if he be of a harlot? ſhall not (ſayeth he) the infant be baptiſed? If it were not that M. doctor in aſking theſe queſtions dothe alſo anſwer them / and anſweareth them farre otherwyſe then the truthe doeth ſuffer / I would not be drawne from the cauſes whych we haue in hand by theſe roging queſtions / nowe I can not leaue them vnanſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red / becauſe I ſee that mayſter Doctor dothe make of the holy Sacrament of baptiſme (whych is an entry into the houſe of God / and whereby only the family of God muſt enter) a common paſſage wherby he will haue cleane and vncleane / holy and prophane / as well thoſe that are wythout the couenaunt as thoſe that be wythin it / to paſſe by: and ſo maketh the church no houſholde / but an Iune to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue whoſoeuer commeth. I will anſwere therfore almoſt in as many words / as the queſtions be aſked. If one of the parents be neyther drunkarde nor adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer / the chylde is holy by vertue of the couenaunt / for one of the parents ſakes. If they be bothe / and yet not obſtinate in their ſynne / whereby the church hathe not proceeded to Excommunication / (them ſelues being yet of the church) their chylde can not / nor ought not to be refuſed. To the ſecond queſtion / wherein he aſketh what if the childe be of Papiſtes or Heretikes. If bothe be Papiſtes / or condenmed heretikes / (if ſo be I may diſtinguiſhe papiſtes from heretikes) and cutte of from the church / then their children can not be receyued / becauſe they are not in the couenaunt: if eyther of them be faithfull / I haue anſweared before that they ought to be receyued. To the other queſtion wherin he aſketh / what if they erre in ſome poynts of matters of faithe. If it be but an error / and be not in thoſe poynts whych caſe the foundations of fayth / becauſe they ſtill notwythſtandyng their error / are to be counted amongſt the faythfull / their children pertaine vnto
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:21261:90"/> the promiſe / and therfore to the ſacrament of the promiſe.</p>
               <p>And in the. 193. page he aſketh / what if the parentes of the chylde bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. If they be / yet if godly men will preſent it to baptiſme / with promiſe of ſeeing it brought vp in the feare of the Lorde / for ſo muche as it is founde in a place where the church is / and therefore by lykelyhoode to appertayne vnto ſome that was of the church: I thinke it may be baptyſed / if the church thinke it good in thys laſt caſe.</p>
               <p>Then hee goeth forth in the. 111. page to proue that the children of thoſe which he hath reckned / may be baptyſed / and demaundeth whether a wicked fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may haue a good child / a papiſt or heretike father a beleuing child? yes verely may they. So may haue and hath the Turke and the Iewe / and yet theyr chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not to be receyued / vnleſſe their fayth doe firſt appeare by confeſſion. But you ſay the papiſt and hereticke be baptiſed / and ſo are not the Iewes and Turkes. Their baptiſme (they being cut of from the church) maketh them as much ſtraungers vnto it / as was Iſmael and Eſau: which albeit they were circumcyſed / yet being caſt out of the church / they were no more to be accompted to be of the body of Gods people / then thoſe whiche neuer were in the church. Now you ſee the poyſon (as you terme it) which lyeth hyd vnder theſe wordes / and if it be as you ſay poyſon / let vs haue ſome of your triacle. In all the reſt of the ſection / there is nothing but that which he ſpake of before / only the elderſhyp is named / which commeth to be entreated of in the next ſection.</p>

               <p>AS though M. Doctor were at vtter defiance with all good order / &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode of wryting / that which was geuen hym orderly by the Admonition / he hath turned vpſyde downe. For where the Admonition ſpeaketh firſt of the elders / then of that which is annexed vnto them / which is the dyſcipline (whereof excommunication is a part) conſydering that the ſubiect is in nature before that which is annexed vnto it / M. Doctor hath turned it cleane contrary / and firſt ſpeaketh of excommunication / and then of the elders. I will therefore that the reader may the eaſelyer vnderſtand that which is ſayde / follow the order of the Admonition / and firſt of all ſpeake of the elders or ſenyors which ought to be in the church. And in ſpeaking of them / I muſt call to remembrance that diuiſion which I made mention on before / that is: Of thoſe which haue care and which gouerne the whole congregation / ſome there be which do both teache the word and gouerne alſo: ſome which doe not teach / but only gouerne / and be ayders in the gouernment / vnto thoſe which doe teache. Thys dyuiſion is moſt manifeſtly ſet forth in the Epiſtle vnto Timothe: where he ſayeth the elders <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> which rule well / are worthy of double honor / and eſpecially thoſe which labor in the word and doctryne / where he maketh by playne and expreſſe words two ſorts of elders / the one which doth both gouerne and teach: the other which gouerneth only. Theſe therefore are the ſenyors which are meant / whoſe office is in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the paſtor or byſhop / in the gouernement of that particulare church / where they be placed paſtors and elders. Now that it is knowne what theſe ſenyors be / in entreating of them I am content to anſwere M. Doctor three requeſtes which he maketh in the. 125. page / where he deſireth that one would do ſo much for hym / as firſt to ſhew that theſe ſenyors were in euery congregation: ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely he will haue it proued that thys regiment is perpetual / and not to be altered: laſt of all he deſireth to know / whether theſe ſenyors were lay men / and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther myniſters of the word and byſhops. Thys laſt is a fond requeſt / and ſuche
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:21261:91"/> as is alredy anſweared / but he muſt be followed. For the firſt therefore / which is / that there were ſegnyors in euery congregation / although M. Doctor in the 114. page / and in the. 132. page / conſtrayned / by Amboſe authoritie / confeſſeth it in playne wordes / yet becauſe he requireth it to be ſhewed / and maketh a ieſt at thoſe places which are alledged out of the ſcripture to proue it / ſome thing muſte be ſpoken thereof. The firſt place is in the Actes / whych is / that Paule &amp; Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas dyd appoynte by election / elders in euerie congregation / but it is not lyke they dyd appoynt dyuers miniſters or biſhops / which preached in euery congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation / which were not to be had for ſuche a number of congregations as were <note place="margin">Actes. 14. 23.</note> then to bee preached vnto: therefore in euery congregation there were beſides thoſe that preached / other elders which dyd only in gouernment aſſiſt the paſtors which preached. And what ſhould we follow comectures heere / when S. Paule doth in the place before alledged declare / what theſe elders are. But M. Doctor <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> ſayeth that there is no mention made of the office of ſuch an elder: therefore that place maketh nothing to proue that there ſhoulde be ſuch elders in euery congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. So M. Doctor wryte / he careth not what he write. Belike he thinketh the credite of hys degree of Doctorſhyp / will geue waight to that which is light / and pithe to that which is froth / or elſe he would neuer anſwere thus. For then I will if thys be a good reaſon ſay / that for ſo much as S. Luke doth not in that <note place="margin">Actes. 14. 17.</note> place deſcribe the office of the paſtor or byſhoppe which preacheth the woorde / therefore that place proueth not that in euery congregation there ſhould be a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or a paſtor. Beſides that / M. Doctor taketh vp the authors of the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition for reaſoning negatiuely of the teſtimony of all the ſcriptures / and yet hee reaſoneth negatiuely of one only ſentence in the ſcripture. For he would conclude that for ſo much as there is no duetie of a ſenyor deſcribed in that place / therefore there is no duety at all / and conſequently no ſenyor.</p>
               <p>Afterwardes he ſayeth / that for ſo much as thys place hath bene vſed to proue a paſtor or byſhop in euery church / therfore it can not be vſed to proue theſe elders / ſo that (ſayeth he) there muſt needes be eyther a contradiction or elſe a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification. The place is rightly alledged for both the one and the other / and yet neyther contradiction to them ſelues / nor falſification of the place: but only a muſt before M. Doctors eyes / which will not let hym ſee a playne and euident truth / which is / that the word (elder) is generall / and comprehendeth both thoſe elders which teach and gouerne / and thoſe which gouerne only / as hath bene ſhewed out of S. Paule. And whereas M. Doctor ſayeth / that the place of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> may bee vnderſtanded of cyuill magiſtrates / of preaching myniſters / of gouernoures of the whole churche / and not of euery particulare churche / and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally any thing / rather then that wherof it is in deede vnderſtanded: I ſay firſt that he ſtyll ſtumbleth at one ſtone / which is / that he can not put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the church and common wealth: and ſo betwene the church officers which he there ſpeaketh of / and the officers of the common wealth / thoſe which are ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall: and thoſe which are cyuill. Then that he meaneth not the myniſter which proacheth / it may appeare / for that he had noted them before in the worde (teachers) and laſt of all he can not meane gouernoure of the whole church / on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he ſhoulde meane a Pope / and if he will ſay he meaneth an Archbyſhop which gouerneth a whole prouince / beſides that it is a bolde ſpeach without all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant / I haue ſhewed before that the word of God alloweth of no ſuch office / and therefore it remayneth that it muſt be vnderſtanded of thys office of Elders. The ſame anſwere may be made vnto that which he ſayeth of the place to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines / where ſpeaking of the offyces of the church / after that hee had ſet forth <note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> the office of the paſtor / and of the doctor / he addeth thoſe other two offices of the Churche / whereof one was occupyed in the gouernement only / the other in prouyding for the poore / and helping the ſicke. And if beſides the manifeſt words
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21261:91"/> of the Apoſtle in both theſe places / I ſhoulde adde the ſentences of the wryters vpon thoſe places / as M. Caluin / M. Beza / M. Martyr / M. Bucer. &amp;c. It ſhould eaſely appeare / what iuſt cauſe M. Doctor hath to ſay / that it is to daily with the ſcriptures / and to make them a noſe of waxe / in alledging of theſe to proue the elders / that all men might vnderſtand / what terrible outcryes he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth / as in thys place / ſo almoſt in all other / when there is cauſe / that he ſhoulde lay hys hand vpon hys mouth.</p>
               <p>Thys I am compelled to wryte / not ſo much to proue that there were ſeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors in euery church (which is a thing confeſſed) as to redeame thoſe places from M. Doctors falſe and corrupt interpretations. And as for the proufe of elders in euery congregation / beſydes hys confeſſion / I neede haue no more but hys owne reaſon: For he ſayeth that the office of theſe elders in euery church / was in that tyme wherein there were no chriſtian magiſtrates / and when there was perſecution / but in the Apoſtles tymes there was both perſecution / and no chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian magiſtrates / therefore in theyr tyme the office of theſe elders was in euery congregation. I come therefore to the ſecond poynt wherein the queſtion eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lyeth / which is / whether thys function be perpetuall / and ought to remayne alwayes in the churche. And it is to be obſerued by the way / that where as there are dyuers ſortes of aduerſaryes to thys diſciplyne of the church / Maiſter Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is amongſt the worſt. For there be that ſaye / that thys order may be vſed or not vſed now / at the lybertie of the churches: But M. Doctor ſayeth that thys order is not for theſe tymes / but only for thoſe tymes when there were no chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian magiſtrates / and ſo doth flatly pinch at thoſe churches which hauing chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian magiſtrates / yet notwithſtanding retayne thys order ſtill.</p>
               <p>And to the ende that the vanitie of thys diſtinction / which is / that there oughte to bee ſenyors or auncientes in the tymes of perſecution / and not of peace: vnder tyrantes and not vnder chriſtian magiſtrates may appeare: the cauſe why theſe ſenyors or auncientes were appoynted in the church / is to bee conſydered / which muſt needes be graunted to bee / for that the paſtor not being able to ouerſee all hym ſelfe / and to haue hys eyes in euery corner of the church / and places where the churches aboade / might be helped of the auncientes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wonderfull loue of God towards hys church doth manifeſtly appeare / that for the greater aſſurance of the ſaluation of hys / dyd not content hym ſelfe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt one only ouerſeer of euery church / but many ouer euery church.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing that the paſtor is now in the tyme of peace / and vnder a chriſtian magiſtrate not able to ouerſee all hym ſelfe / nor hys eyes can not bee in euery place of the paryſhe preſent to beholde the behauiour of the people / it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that as well now as in the tyme of perſecution / as well vnder a chriſtian prince as vnder a tyrant / the office of an auncient or ſeignior is required. Onles you will ſay that God hath leſſe care of hys church in the time of peace and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a godly magiſtrate / then he hath in the tyme of perſecution / and vnder a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. In deede if ſo bee the auncientes in the tyme of perſecution and vnder a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant / had medled with any office of a magiſtrate / or had ſupplyed the roume of a godly magiſtrate / in handling of any of thoſe things which belonged vnto hym / then there had bene ſome cauſe why a godly magiſtrate being in the church / the office of the ſenior / or at leaſt ſo much as he exerciſed of the office of a magiſtrate / ſhuld haue ceaſed.</p>
               <p>But when as the auncient neither dyd / nor by any meanes might meddle with thoſe things which belonged vnto a magiſtrate / no more vnder a tyrant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder a godly magiſtrate / there is no reaſon why the magiſtrate entring into the church / the elder ſhuld be therfore thruſt out. For the elders office was to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſeuerally / thoſe that dyd amiſſe / to comfort thoſe which he ſaw weake &amp; ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king / and to haue neede of comfort / to aſſiſt the paſtor in eccleſiaſticall cenſures of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21261:92"/> reprehenſions / ſharper or milder as the faultes required / alſo to aſſiſt in the ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the ſupper of the Lord vntill ſome triall were had of the repentance of that party which had confeſſed hym ſelfe to haue offended / or elſe if he remayned ſtubburne / to aſſiſt hym in the excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theſe were thoſe things / which the elders dyd / which forſomuch as they may doe as well vnder a chriſtian magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate / as vnder a tyrant / as well in the tyme of peace as in the tyme of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / it followeth that as touching the office of elders / there is no diſtinction in the tymes of peace and perſecution / of a chriſtian prince and of a tyrant. But I will yet come nearer. That without the which / the principal offices of charitie can not be excerciſed / is neceſſary and alwayes to be kept in the church. But the office of auncients &amp; elders are ſuch as with out which the principal offices of charity can not be exerciſed / therefore it followeth that thys office is neceſſary. That the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall offices of charity can not be exerciſed without thys order of auncientes / it may appeare for that he which hath faulted / and amendeth not after he be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed once priuately / and then before one wytnes or two / can not further be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded agaynſt / according to the commaundement of our ſauior Chriſt / onleſſe there be in the church / auncients and elders / therefore thys principall office of charitie / which tendeth to the amendment of hym which hath not profited by thoſe two former admonitions / can not be exerciſed without them. For it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded of our ſauiour Chriſt / that in ſuch a caſe when a brother doth not profite by theſe <note place="margin">Math. 18. 15.</note> two warnings / it ſhould be tolde the church. Now I would aſke who be meant by the church heere / if he ſay by the church are meant all the people / then I will aſke how a man can conueniently complayne to all the whole congregation / or how can the whole congregation conueniently meete to decide of thys matter. I doe not deny / but the people haue an intereſt in the excommunication / as ſhall be noted heereafter / but the matter is not ſo farre come / for hee muſt firſt refuſe to obey the admonition of the church / or euer they can proceede ſo farre. Well / if it be not the people that be meant by the church / who is it? I heare M. Doctor ſay it is the paſtor / but if he will ſay ſo / and ſpeake ſo ſtraungely / he muſt warrant it wyth ſome other places of ſcripture where the church is taken for one / which is as much to ſay as one man is many / one member is a body / one alone is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And beſydes thys ſtrangenes of ſpeach / it is cleane contrary to the meaning of our ſauiour Chriſt / and deſtroyeth the ſoueraignitie of the medycine which our ſauiour Chriſt prepared for ſuch a feſtered ſore / as would neyther be healed with priuate admonition / neyther with admonition before one or two witneſſes. For as the fault groweth / ſo our ſauiour Chriſt woulde haue the number of thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whome he ſhoulde be checked and rebuked / lykewiſe grow. Therefore from a priuate admonition he ryſeth vnto the admonition before two or three / &amp; from them to the church / which if we ſhould ſay it is but one / then to a daungerouſer wound ſhould be layde an eaſier plaiſter: and therefore our ſauiour doth not ryſe from two to one / (for that were not to ryſe but to fall / nor to proceede but to goe backward (but to many. Seeing then that the church heere is neyther the whole congregation / nor the paſtor alone / it followeth that by the church here he meaneth the paſtor / with the auncients or elders. Or elſe whome can he meane? And as for thys manner of ſpeach / wherein by the church is vnderſtanded the cheefe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours and elders of the church / it is oftentymes vſed in the olde Teſtament / from the which our ſauiour borowed thys maner of ſpeaking / as in Exodus it is ſayde. That Moſes wrought hys myracles before the people / when mention is <note place="margin">4. chap. 29. 30.</note> made before / only of the elders of the people / whome Moſes had called together. And moſt manifeſtly in * Ioſue / where it is ſayde / that he that kylled a man at <note place="margin">20. chap. 4. 6.</note> vnwares / ſhall returne vnto the citie vntill he ſtand before the congregration to be iudged. Where by the congregation / he meaneth the gouernoures of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation / for it dyd not appertayne to all to iudge of thys caſe. Lykewyſe in the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21261:92"/> Chronicles / and dyuers other places. And therefore I conclude that forſomuch <note place="margin">1. li. 13. cap. 2. 4.</note> as thoſe be neceſſary and perpetuall which are ſpoken of in thoſe wordes (tell the Church) and that vnder thoſe wordes are comprehended the elders or aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes / that the elders and auncientes be neceſſary and perpetuall officers in the church. Furthermore S. Paule hauing entreated throughout the whole firſt Epiſtle to Timothe / of the orders which ought to be in the church of God / and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernment / as hym ſelfe wytneſſeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third chapter of that Epiſtle (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayeth he wrote that Epiſtle to teach Timothe how he ſhoulde behaue hym ſelfe in the houſe of God) and hauing ſet forth both byſhoppe / and elder / and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons / as myniſters and officers of the church / in the ſhutting vp of hys Epiſtle he (for the obſeruation of all the orders of that Epiſtle) adiureth Timothe / and <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 13. 14.</note> with the inuocation of the name of God ſtrayghtly chargeth hym / to obſerue thoſe thinges which hee had preſcribed in that Epiſtle. I charge thee (ſayeth hee) before God which quickeneth all things / and before Ieſus Chriſt which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed vnder Pontius Pilate a good profeſſion that thou keepe thys commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement without ſpot or blemiſhe / vntill the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. The wayght of which ſentence for the obſeruing of thoſe things which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in thys Epiſtle / that it may be the better vnderſtanded / I will note the wordes ſeuerally.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore it is to be noted that he ſayeth (I denounce or I charge.) He doth not ſay (I exhorte or giue counſell) leauing it to the lyberty of Timothe.</p>
               <p>Secondarely it is to be noted / that he calleth the whole Epiſtle a commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement / and therefore it is no permiſſion / ſo that it may be lawfull for the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to leaue it / or to keepe it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly / when he maketh mention of the lyuing God / and of Chriſt / which witneſſed a good profeſſion vnder Pontius Pilate / he ſheweth that the thinges contayned in thys Epiſtle are ſuch / as for the mayntenaunce thereof wee ought not to doubt to geue our lyues / and that they be not ſuch as we ought to kepe / ſo that we haue them without ſtrife and without ſweate / or eaſely / but ſuch as for the keeping of them if we haue them / and for the obtayning of them if we haue them not (I will not ſay our honoures / or our commodities and wealth / but as I haue ſayd) our lyues ought not to be deare vnto vs. For therefore doth hee make mention of the confeſſion of Chriſt vnto the death / that he might ſhew vs an example / and forthwith ſpeaketh of God / which rayſeth from the dead / that by thys meanes he might comfort Timothe if he ſhould be brought into any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the defence of any of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Fourthly / if we refer thoſe wordes without ſpot or blemiſh vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement (as I for my part thinke they ought to be) then there is a waight in theſe words not to be paſſed ouer / which is / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the apoſtle will not only haue the rules heere contayned / not troden vnder the feete / or broken in peeces / but hee will not haue them ſo much as in any one ſmall poynt or ſpecke neglected. But I ſee how M. Doctor will wype away all thys / and ſay that theſe thinges / or ſome of them were to bee obſerued thus neceſſarily and preciſely / vntill there were chriſtian prynces and peace in the churche: but the print is deeper then that it will bee ſo waſhed away. Therefore it is to be obſerued / what he ſayeth in the latter end of the ſentence / where he chargeth Timothe / and in hym all / that hee ſhould keepe all theſe things / not vntill the tyme of peace / or to the times of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes / but euen vntill the comming or appearing of our ſauiour Chriſt / which is as long as the world laſteth. And therfore I conclude that the ſeigniors or elders of the church (being a part of that order and gouernment of the church / which S. Paule appoynteth in thys Epiſtle) are neceſſary / perpetuall / and by no meanes to be changed. So that we haue / not only now the examples of all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue churches (which ought to moue vs / if there were no commaundement) but
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21261:93"/> we haue alſo a ſtraight commaundement: I ſay the onely examples ought to moue vs / for what way can we ſafelyer follow / then the common hygh way / bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and troden by the ſteps of all the Apoſtles / and of all the churches? Things alſo growing / and being preſerued by the ſame meanes by the which they were ingendred / why ſhoulde we thinke but that the churches now will proſper by that gouernment / whereby it firſt came vp? But I ſay we haue not only the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the churches / but wee haue alſo commaundement and ſtrayght charge to keepe thys office of elders and auncientes in the church / and therefore it is not onely raſhneſſe in leauing the way that the Apoſtles and churches by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles aduiſe haue gone / but diſobedyence alſo to depart from theyr commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / and to mayntayne and defend that we may doe ſo / I can almoſt geue it no gentler name then rebellion.</p>
               <p>Now I will come to Mayſter Doctors reaſons which he hath in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and fourteene / and a hundred and fifteene pages / where he graunteth that there were elders in euery church in tymes paſt / but ſayth that it ought not now ſo to bee. For ſayeth hee / the tymes alter the gouernment / and it can not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned in the tyme of proſperitie / as in the tyme of perſecution / vnder a chriſtian prince as vnder a tyrant. Thus he ſayeth / but ſheweth no reaſon / bringeth no proofe / declareth not how nor why proſperity will not beare the Elders as well as perſecution / neyther why they may not be vnder a godly prince as well as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a tyrant / onles thys be a reaſon / that becauſe the godly prince doth nouriſhe the church as a cyuill magiſtrate / therefore the auncientes may not nouriſh it as Eccleſiaſticall ouerſeers.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing Maiſter Doctor can ſhew vs no cauſe why they may not as well be now / as in the tyme of the Apoſtles / as well vnder a chriſtian prince as vnder a tyrant / I will ſhew hym that although they be alwayes neceſſary / yet there is better cauſe why they ſhould rather be now then in the apoſtles times / greater neceſſyty vnder a chriſtian prince / then vnder a tyrant. Firſt of all in the apoſtles tymes it is knowne that the giftes of the ſpirite of wiſedome / diſcretion / knowledge / enduring of trauaile / were poured forth more plentifully then euer they were / eyther before / or ſhall be after. By reaſon whereof the paſtoures and myniſters of the churches that were then / were (I ſpeake generally / and of the eſtate of the whole Church) better furnyſhed with the giftes needefull for their myniſtery / then are the myniſters of theſe dayes. Wherupon I conclude that if the ayde and aſſiſtance of the paſtor by the Elders / was thought neceſſary by the apoſtles in thoſe tymes / when the myniſters were ſo well / and ſo richly repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſuch giftes / much more is that ayde and aſſiſtance meete for the myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of theſe dayes / wherein their giftes of diſcretion and knowledge / and dyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence / are not ſo plentifull. For if they whoſe eye ſight was ſo cleare to perceiue / whoſe handes ſo nimble to execute / had neede for their ayde / of other eyes &amp; other handes / then the myniſters now / whoſe eyes are dimmer / and hands heauier then theirs were / haue much more neede of thys ayde then they had.</p>
               <p>Agayne / if S. Paule dyd charge the perſecuted / &amp; therefore pore churches / <note place="margin">1. Epiſt. 5. 17.</note> with the fineding and prouiding for the ſenyors in euery church (as it appeareth in the Epiſtle to Timothe / where he ſayeth that Elders whiche rule well / are worthy double honour / whereby he ſignifyeth a plentifull rewarde / and ſuche as may be fully ſufficient for them and their houſholdes / as when he biddeth that the widdow which ſerued the churche in attending vpon the ſicke / and vppon the ſtraungers ſhoulde be honoured / that is / haue that wherewyth ſhee might ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and ſoberly liue) if I ſay Saynt Paule woulde charge the churches then with mayntayning the elders / which being poore / were not ſometimes hable to liue without ſome reliefe from the church / becauſe they were compelled often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to leaue their owne affaires / to wayte of the affaires of the church: how
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21261:93"/> much more ought there now to be ſenyors / when the churches be in peace / and therefore not ſo pore / and when there may be choſen ſuch for the moſt part tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the realme / as are able to liue without charging the church any whit / as the practiſe of theſe dayes doth manifeſtly declare.</p>
               <p>And if S. Paule that was ſo deſirous to haue the goſpell <hi>adapanon,</hi> that <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 18.</note> is / free and without charges as much as is poſſible / and ſo loth to lay any bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vpon the churches / eſpecially thoſe which were poore / dyd notwithſtanding enioyne the mayntenaunce of the elders vnto the churches poore and perſecuted / how much more ſhall we thincke / that hys mynde was that the Churches which liue in peace / and are rich / and may haue thys office without charge / ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thys order of auncientes?</p>
               <p>Moreouer thoſe that be learned know / that the gouernement of the church which was in the apoſtles tymes / being partly in reſpect of the people that had to doe in the elections and other things popular: partly in reſpect of the paſtors and auncientes Ariſtocraticall / that is the rule of the beſt: I ſay they know that theſe gouernmentes do eaſely declyne into their contraries / and by reaſon therof both the gouernment of thoſe which were moſt vertuous / might eaſely be chaunged into the gouernment of few of the richeſt / or of greateſt power / and the populare eſtate might eaſely paſſe to a confuſed tumulte. Now thys incommoditie were they more ſubiect vnto vnder a tyrant / then vnder a godly prince. For they had no cyuill magiſtrate which might correct and reforme thoſe declyninges when they happened. For the tyrantes dyd not know of it / and if they had known of it / they would haue bene glad to ſee the churches goe to wracke. Therfore now we haue a godly ciuil magiſtrate / which both wil &amp; ought to remedy ſuch declinings &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions of good gouernment into euill / it followeth that thys eſtate &amp; gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by auncientes / is rather to be vſed vnder a chriſtian prince then vnder a tyrant.</p>
               <p>Beſides thys / in the tyme of perſecution all aſſemblyes of dyuers together were daungerous and put them all in hazard of their lyfe which dyd make thoſe aſſemblies: And therefore if the paſtor alone might haue ordered and determyned of things pertayning to the church by hym ſelfe / it had bene leſſe daunger to him / and more ſafety for others of the Church. And therfore if the ſenyors were then thought meete to gouerne the church / when they could not come together to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their functions without daunger / much more ought they to be vnder a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prince / when they may meete together without daunger.</p>
               <p>M. Doctor proceedeth / &amp; ſayeth it can not be gouerned in a whole realme / as it may be in a citie or town. This gouernment by ſenyors is not only in one ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie / but alſo hath beene of late throughout the whole realme of Fraunce / where there were any churches: and M. Doctor confeſſeth that it was in all the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue churches / and therefore not onely in one realme / but almoſt throughout the whole world / and therefore the large ſpreading of the church / can not hynder it. So that the difference lyeth ſtill in the peace and perſecution of the Church / and not in the capacitie and largeneſſe of the place where the churches abyde. So might one reaſon agaynſt the lawfull eſtate of a Monarchie: For he might ſay that although the rule of one be needefull and conuenient in a houſholde / yet it is not conuenient in a towne / and although it be conuenient in a towne / yet it is not in a citie / and although in a citie / yet not in a realme.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort ſayeth hee / when he can ſay no more / it can not be gouerned when it is full of hypocrites / Papiſtes / Atheiſtes / and other wicked perſons / as in the times of perſecution / when there were few or none ſuch. I haue ſhewed before / how great want of knowledge it bewrayeth / to ſay that Papiſtes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtes be of the church / and I loue not as Maiſter Doctor doth to vſe often repetition / but if there bee now moe hypocrites &amp; other wicked and vnruely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church / then there were in the tyme of perſecution (which I wil not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21261:94"/> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is greater cauſe now / why there ſhould be ſenyors in euery churche / then there was then when there were fewer. For the more naughty perſons / and the greater diſorders there be / the more ayde and helpe hath the paſtor neede to haue / both to finde out their diſorders / and alſo when they haue founde them out / to iudge of the qualitie of them / and after alſo to correct them with the cenſures of the church / which ſtandeth in ſuch reprehenſions priuate and open / and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication / as I haue before rehearſed.</p>
               <p>Afterwarde he aſketh what ſenyors may bee had in moſt of the paryſhes of Englande fitte for that office? he aſketh the ſame queſtion in the. 133. page / where he alſo addeth paſtors / aſking where may be gotten ſuch paſtoures as the authors of the Admonition require / when as they require no other then thoſe which the word of God requireth. Well then if thys be a good reaſon why there ſhould be no elders in any church / becauſe fitte men are not to be gotten in all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhes: it followeth by M. Doctors reaſon / that foraſmuch as we haue not fit and able paſtors for euery church / that therfore we ought to haue no able paſtor in any church.</p>
               <p>And if he will graunt that we ought to haue able paſtoures in as many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as they may be gotten: how can he deny / that wee ſhould haue elders in thoſe churches where fitte men may bee had. And I ſay further / where wee haue an expreſſe commaundement layde vpon vs to doe a thing / there all diſputations muſt ceaſe / of hardenes / of impoſſibility / or profite / or elſe of peace. For firſt God hath not commaunded any orders in hys churche which are impoſſible / and if they ſeeme harde / it muſt bee remembred / that the beſt and excellenteſt things are hardeſt / and that there is nothing ſo harde / which dyligence and trauayle to bring it to paſſe / will not ouercome. Which thing if it bee proued true in worldly affaires / the truth therof will much more appeare in the matters pertayning vnto God / conſidering that if God with hys bleſſing doe ſurmount all the difficultyes in worldly matters whych are otherwyſe harde to be compaſſed / hee will in hys owne matters / and matters pertayning to hys glory / fill vp the valleys / although they be neuer ſo low / bring downe the hylles / althoughe they bee neuer ſo high / playne the wayes be they neuer ſo rough: ſo that he will make of a way not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in the eyes of fleſh / away tracked and eaſie to goe in / and to walke towardes that kingdome / whereunto hee calleth vs. Beſides that / I anſwere whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer there is a churche / there are the riches of the ſpirite of God / there is wyth knowledge / diſcretion &amp; wiſdom / and there are ſuche as * S. Paule calleth wiſe / <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 15.</note> and can diſcerne and iudge. And wee ſee that when men are called to a lawfull and profitable calling / and eſpecially to a publike calling / God doth powre on hys giftes of that perſon which is called ſo plentifully / that hee is as it were ſodenly made a newe manne / which if he do in the wicked as Saule was / there is no <note place="margin">1. Sam. 10. 6.</note> doubt but he will doe it in thoſe / which are with the teſtimony of the church / and with experience of their former godly behauiour / choſen to ſuch offices of waight. So that there is not / nor can not bee any want to obey Goddes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / and to eſtabliſhe the order in the church whych God hath appoynted / but our owne eyther neglygence and ſlouthfulnes / or fearefulnes / or ambition / or ſome other leuen which we nouriſh within our ſelues. It is true / that we ought to be obedyent vnto the cyuill magiſtrate / which gouerneth the church of God in that office which is committed vnto hym / and according to that calling. But it muſt be remembred / that cyuil magiſtrates muſt gouerne it according to the rules of God preſcribed in hys word / &amp; that as they are nouriſes / ſo they be ſeruauntes vnto the church / and as they rule in the churche / ſo they muſt remember to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect them ſelues vnto the churche / to ſubmit their ſcepters / to throw downe their crownes / before the church / yea as the Prophet ſpeaketh / to licke the duſt of the <note place="margin">Eſay. 49. 23.</note> feete of the churche. Wherein I meane not / that the churche doth eyther wring
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21261:94"/> the ſcepters out of Princes hands / or taketh their crownes from their heads / or that it requireth Princes to licke the duſt of her feete (as the Pope vnder thys pretence hath done) but I meane as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet meaneth / that whatſoeuer mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence / or excellencye / or pompe / is eyther in them or in their eſtates and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes / whych doth not agree wyth the ſimplicity / and in the iudgement of the world) poore and contemptible eſtate of the church / that that they will be content to lay downe.</p>
               <p>And heere commeth to my minde / that wherwyth the world is now decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued / and wherwyth M. doctor goeth about bothe to deceiue him ſelfe and others to / in that he thinketh that the church muſt be framed according to the common wealth / and the church gouernment accordyng to the ciuill gouernment / whych is as much to ſay / as if a man ſhuld faſhion hys houſe according to hys ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gings / when as in deede it is cleane contrary / that as the hangings are made fit for the houſe / ſo the common wealth muſt be made to agree wyth the church / and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment therof wyth her gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For as the houſe is before the hangings / &amp; therefore the hangings whych come after / muſt be framed to the houſe whych was before: ſo the church being before there was any common wealthe / and the common wealthe comming after / muſte be faſhioned and made ſutable vnto the church. Otherwyſe God is made to geue place to men / heauen to earth / and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is made (as it were) a rule of Leſbia / to be applyed vnto any eſtate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Seing that good men / that is to ſay the church / are as it were the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde / it is meete that the common wealthe whych is builded vppon that foundation / ſhould be framed according to the churche / &amp; therfore thoſe voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought not to be heard / thys order will not agree wyth oure common wealth / that lawe of God is not for our ſtate / thys forme of gouernment will not matche wyth the pollicy of thys realme.</p>
               <p>Nowe to come againe to M. Doctors reaſons / he ſayeth in the. 133. page / that if they vrge gouernoures becauſe they are ſpoken of in the. 12. to the Corin. then they may as well vrge the power to worke miracles / the gift of healing. &amp;c. for that they are likewyſe reckened vp in the ſame place. But dothe not M. doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor know / that although ſome thyngs be extraordinarye / and for a time / yet other ſome thyngs are ordinary / and to endure alwayes? Will he ſay for that the gifts of miracles and of healing are extraordinarye / therefore the teachers whych are there reckened together wyth the gift of working miracles and of healing are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary? hath he forgotten that he (in deede vntruely) made before the office of Apoſtles and Prophets / and Euangeliſts / a perpetual office / and yet they are there ioyned wyth theſe gifts whych were but for a time / and therfore it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſurde argument to ſaye / that for that ſome thyng reckened with gouernors / is for a time / and extraordinary / therfore the gouernors be ſo. As for Muſculus authoritye / whych is / that the tymes do chaunge the orders / beſides that I haue anſweared before / and beſides that he dothe not ſpeake it of the Elders / I haue proued that it can haue no place heere / for ſo much as the Elders are neceſſarye / and commaunded in the ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Vnto the authors of the Admonition ſaying that it is eaſier to ouerthrowe by bryving / one man / then the fayth and piety of a godly company: he anſweareth / that ſo it ſhould come to paſſe / that the moe that ruled / the better eſtate it ſhoulde be / and ſo the populare eſtate ſhould be the beſt. But where do the authors of the admonition ſay / that the more that rule / the better it is? is it all one to ſaye / that the gouernment of a fewe of the beſt / is better then the gouernment of one / and to ſaye / the more that rule the better? If it were to the purpoſe / it myghte be ſhewed both by Diuinitye and by Philoſophye / whych M. Doctor ſpeaketh of / that that eſtate whych he meaneth / is not the beſt: and I haue in a word before
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21261:95"/> ſpoken of it / where I declared that the mixed eſtate is beſt / bothe by the example of the kingdome of Chriſt / and alſo of thys our realme. It is ſufficient nowe to admonyſhe you / that although it be graunted that the gouernment of one / be the beſt in the common wealth / yet it can not be in the church. For the Prince may wel be Monarche immediately betwene God &amp; the common wealth / but no man can be Monarche betwene God &amp; hys church but Chriſt / whych is the only head therof. Therfore the Monarchie ouer the whole church / and ouer euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare church / and ouer euery ſingular membre in the church / is in Chryſt alone.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all / to proue that there ought to be no ſenyors in the church vnder a Chriſtian prince / he citeth Ambroſes authority both in the. 114. and. 132. pages / whych ſayeth that the ſinagogue or church of the Iewes / &amp; after that the church of the chryſtians had ſenyors / wythout whoſe counſell nothyng was done in the church: whervpon he concludeth / that for as much as they were not in Ambroſe tyme / therfore they were not vnder a chriſtian prince. And heere M. doctor hath in one ſentence proclaimed bothe hys great ignorance in the whole ſtorye of the churche / and wythall eyther a maruellous abuſion / and ſuffering hym ſelfe to be miſled by ſome vnaduyſed prompter / or ſubtile foxe that thought to deceyne him / or elſe a notable euill conſcience / whych wraſtleth agaynſt the truthe. Hys igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth appeare partly in that he ſayeth / that becauſe there were no ſenyors in Amb. church / and in thoſe churches about hym / therefore there was none at all: but moſte manifeſtly in that he ſayeth / for ſo much as there were no ſenyors in Amb. time / therefore there was none vnder a chriſtian Prince / as though there were not many yeres before Amb. tyme chriſtian Emperors / when as betwene the tyme of S. Ambroſe being byſhop / and the tyme of Phillip ſucceſſor of Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias the firſt chriſtian Emperor / there is more then a. 150. yeares / and betweene the time of Conſtantine the Emperor / and the tyme of Ambroſe being byſhop / there be aboue. 80. yeares. And if M. Doctor had euer red the eccleſiaſticall ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes / he mought haue founde eaſely the elderſhyp moſte flouriſhyng in Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines tyme / and other tymes / when as the peace of the chryſtians was greateſt.</p>
               <p>And that the preſbyterie or elderſhyp endured in the church after Ambroſe tyme / and in the tyme of peace / and as it is very lyke in Amb. tyme / although not where he was / it may be ſhewed plainly by Ierome (whych folowed Ambroſe <note place="margin">4. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>lib. in Iſalam.</hi>
                  </note> immediatlye) who in hys third chapter vpon Eſay / ſayeth that they had alſo the preſbyterie or elderſhyp in the church. The ſame myght be ſhewed by diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimonies / whych I omit / becauſe that it may appeare by the former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe touchyng the election of the myniſter / that thys order of elderſhyp continued in the church diuers hundreth yeares after Ambroſe tyme / euen as long almoſte as there was any ſound part of the church / from the head to the heele. Nowe I haue ſhewed the ignorance / it remayneth to ſhewe howe that eyther M. Doctor was maruellouſly hym ſelfe abuſed / or elſe deſyreth to abuſe other. For if wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he toke halfe Ambroſe ſentence / he had taken the other halfe wyth hym / and had not ſodenly ſtopped hys breath that he ſhould ſpeake no more / in ſteade of a falſe wytnes agaynſt the elderſhyp / he ſhould haue brought forthe as cleare and as flat a witnes for the proofe of them / as a man coulde deſire out of an auncient wryter. The whole ſentence is thys / ſpeakyng of thys offyce of the elders / (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not vpon ſo good occaſyon) thus he ſayeth: Whervpon the ſinagoge / and <note place="margin">Ambroſe vpon 1. Tim. chap. 5</note> after the church had elders / wythout whoſe counſell nothyng was done in the church / whych Elders I know not by what neglygence they are worne out / on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it be through the ſlouthfulnes of the doctors / or rather throughe theyr pryde / whyleſt they only would ſeeme to be ſomewhat.</p>
               <p>Now that I haue ſhewed the place / I wyll ſay no more / I wyl leaue it to M. Doctor to thinke of it in his chamber by hym ſelfe / and ſo will conclude this queſtion: that for ſo much as thys order is ſuch / as wythout whych / the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21261:95"/> offices of charity can not be exercyſed: and that it is that which is commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſcryptures / approued and receyued by all the churches in the Apoſtles tymes / and many hundreth yeares after in the moſt flouryſhing churches / bothe in tyme of peace / &amp; in tyme of perſecution: and that there are greater cauſes why it ſhould be in the tyme of peace / then in tyme of perſecution / why rather vnder a chriſtian prince / then vnder a tyrant / why rather now / then in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtles times / that in conſyderation of theſe things / the elderſhyp is neceſſary / and ſuch an order as the church ought not to be wythout. And ſo alſo is anſweared the third que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion / that for ſo much as they were church offycers / and ouer the people in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> pertayning to God / &amp; ſuch as watched ouer the ſoules of men / that therfore although they were not paſtors to preach the word / yet were they no lay men (as they terme them) but eccleſiaſticall perſons. The reſt comprehended in theſe ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions / is anſweared before / being matter whych pertayned vnto the archbyſhop.</p>
               <p>Nowe I returne backe agayne to Excommunicacion / whych M. Doctor thynketh to be the only diſciplyne in the church / but he ſhuld vnderſtand / that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde that parte of priuate diſciplyne / (whych is ordinarily and dayly to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by euery one of the paſtors &amp; elders / as Admonition and reprehenſion) there are .iij. princypal parts / whych are exerciſed of them ioyntly and together / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt is the election or choyſe / and the abdication or putting out of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall officers. The ſecond is in excommunication of the ſtubburne / or abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tant. The third is the deciſion of all ſuch matters as doe ryſe in the church / eyther touchyng corrupt manners / or peruerſe doctryne.</p>
               <p>As touchyng the election / and conſequently the throwing out / it hath bene ſhewed before / that together wyth the churche / the elderſhyp hathe the principall ſway. For the deciſion of controuerſyes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ryſe / it may appeare in the. 15. of the Acts / that the Preſbyterie or Elderſhyp of the churche hath to determine of that alſo. Nowe it remayneth heere / that whereas M. Doctor ſayeth that the Excommunication / and conſequently the abſolution or reſtoryng to the church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne / doth pertayne only to the miniſter / that I ſhewe that the Preſbyterye or elderſhip / and the whole church alſo / hath intereſt in the Excommunication / and conſequently in the abſolution or reſtoryng vnto the churche. But heere by the way it is to be noted / that in ſaying that it belongeth to the miniſter / he confeſſeth the dyſorder in our church / wherin this power is taken away from the miniſter / and geuen to the byſhop and hys offycers.</p>
               <p>Nowe that thys charge of excommunication belongeth not vnto one / or to the minyſter / but cheefely to the elderſhyp and paſtor / it appeareth by that whych the authors of the admonition alledge out of S. Mathewe / whych place I haue <note place="margin">Chap. 18. 17.</note> proued before to be neceſſarily vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of the elders of the church. It is moſt abſurdly ſayd of M. doctor in the. 135. page / that by the church is vnderſtanded eyther my Lordes grace / or the byſhop of the dioceſe / or the Chancellor or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſarye. And that when a man complayneth vnto one of theſe / he may be well ſayd to complayne vnto the church: whych is the more vntollerable / for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſtraunge a ſaying / and ſuche as may aſtonyſhe all that heare it / he neyther confirmeth it by any reaſon / or lyke phraſe of ſcrypture / or by the authority of any godly or approued wryter olde or newe / whych notwythſtanding he ſeeketh for ſo diligently / and turneth the commentaries in hys ſtudy ſo painefully / when he can haue but one againſt twentye / and but a ſillable where he can not haue a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. It may be the clearlyer vnderſtanded / that the preſbyterie or elderſhip / had the cheefe ſtroke in this exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication / if it be obſerued / that thys was the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and diſcipline of the Iewes / and of the ſmagogue from whence our ſauyoure Chriſt toke this / and tranſlated it vnto this church / that when any man had don any thing that they held for a fault / that then the ſame was puniſhed and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Elders of the church / according to the quality of the faulte / as it maye appeare in S. Mathewe. For althoughe it be of ſome (and thoſe very learned) <note place="margin">Chap. 5. 22.</note>

And if the fault were iudged very great / then the ſentence of Excommunication was awarded by the ſame elders / as appeareth in S. Iohn. And thys was the cauſe why our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure <note place="margin">Chap. 9. 22.</note> Chriſte ſpake ſo ſhortly of thys matter in the. 18. of S. Mathew / wythout noting the circumſtances more at large / for that he ſpake of a thyng whych was well knowne and vſed amongſt the Iewes whome he ſpake vnto. And that this was the meaning of our ſauioure Chriſte in thoſe wordes / it may appeare by the practiſe whych is ſet forthe in the Epiſtles to the Corinthians. For it is certain that S. Paule dyd bothe vnderſtand and obſerue the rule of our ſauyor Chriſt. But he communicateth thys power of Excommunication wyth the church / and therfore it muſt needes be the meaning of oure ſauioure Chriſte / that the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication ſhould be by many / and not by one / and by the church / and not by the miniſter of the church alone. For he biddeth the church of Corinthe twiſe in the firſt Epiſtle / once by a Metaphore / an other time in playne woordes / that they ſhould excommunicate the inceſtuous perſon. By metaphore / ſaying: (purge out your olde leauen) in playne and flat words / when he ſayeth (take away that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">Chap. 5. 7. 13.</note> man from amongſt you.) And in the ſecond Epiſtle vnderſtanding of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of that man / he entreateth them that they would receyue hym in again / <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 10.</note> ſhewing that he was content to releaſe the bonde and chaine of hys excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation / ſo that they wold do the ſame / and therefore conſydering the abſolution / or reconciliation of the excommunicate / dothe pertaine vnto the church / it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the excommunication doth in lyke manner appertaine vnto it.</p>
               <p>Now / wheras M. Doctor vpon thoſe wordes of S. Paule / that he being abſent in body / and preſent in ſpirite / had determined. &amp;c. concludeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ryght of excommunication was in S. Paule / and not in the reſt / it is as much as if he ſhould ſay / S. Paule as much as lay in hym excommunicated / therfore ſ. Paule excommunicated: or S. Paule excommunicated / therefore the churche dyd not. For what if S. Paule dyd excommunicate hym ſo muche as lay in hym / ſhoulde he therfore haue bene excommunicated / if the church of Corinthe / and the miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter there would haue admitted hym to the ſupper / and not abſtaine from famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are companying wyth hym? You will ſay he ſhould haue bene bounde in heauen and before God / although the church of Corinthe had not put hym forthe. It is true that the apoſtles denunciation of Gods vengeance vpon the impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner / is ratifyed in heauen / and ſo ſhoulde he alſo haue bene if S. Paule had ſayd nothyng / and yet S. Paule dyd not excommunicate the inceſtuous perſone / but ſo much as lay in hym / and as farre as hys ryght ſtretched: not being therfore yet excommunicated by S. Paule / it foloweth that the church had a ſtroke in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. Againe / to proue that the church hath nothyng to doe wyth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication / it is not enoughe to ſay that S. Paule had the ryght of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: But you ſhoulde haue ſhewed that he only had it / and then you are manifeſtly conuicted by S. Paules own words / whych ioyneth the church with hym in that excommunication / ſaying that he had decreed that the doer of that fact (by hys ſpirite / and them gathered together in the name of Ieſus Chriſte / and by hys power) ſhould be geuen to ſathan. And if the right of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were only in S. Paule / how is it that you ſayd before / that it is in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the churche? had the miniſter of the churche of Corinthe nothing to doe? And if it were in S.

But in the .18. of S. Mathewe where he ſpeaketh of the binding and loſing by excommunication and receyuing to the churche agayne / there he attributeth thys power vnto the church. He hath an other obiection out of S. Paule to Timothe / where for that it is ſayde that ſ. Paule dyd excommunicate Hymineus and Alexander / he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth after hys old manner / that therfore he only excommunicated. But for ſo much as I haue proued that both the rule of Chriſt / &amp; the practiſe of S. Paule accordyng to that rule / be otherwyſe / it can not be that S. Paule dyd excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate hym ſelfe alone thoſe perſons: for then he ſhould diſagree bothe wyth our ſauyor Chriſt and wyth hym ſelfe. But as I haue ſhewed before in other eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical actions and exerciſes of diſcipline / that one man is ſayd to do that which was done of many / for becauſe one was moderator of that action or exerciſe: ſo ſ. Paul here ſayeth that he dyd excommunicate / not that he dyd it by hym ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone / but becauſe he was preſident &amp; cheefe in that action. And although it ſhuld be graunted (whych can not) that S. Paule dyd excommunicate hymſelfe alone (being an apoſtle / or for one tyme) yet it neyther foloweth that the byſhop or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may do that whych the apoſtle dyd / or that he may do continually y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which was done but once and extraordinarily. As for the place of Titus the thirde / it maketh nothyng to excommunication / onles you wold conclude that for that S. Paule biddeth Titus to trouble hymſelfe no more wyth confuting an obſtinate hereticke / therfore he biddeth hym excommunicate an hereticke by hym ſelfe. As touching Bafiles place in the ſecond booke of Offices when the booke commeth forth &amp; is Printed / then it ſhalbe anſwered / as for me I know of none ſuch that is extant now. To the reſt I will anſwer wyth thys proteſtation / that if all men ſhould do contrary to the order of God / yet their authority or example ought not to haue the waight of a fether / which I haue ſaid before / &amp; do vnderſtand it in all places wher I do not expres it / &amp; wyth this I come to M. doctors authorities.</p>
               <p>And as for Theodoretus byſhop of Laodicea / whych Sozomene maketh mention of in hys ſixthe booke / I finde none ſuche / but there is mentioned of one Theodotus / who is ſayd to haue ſeperated or excommunicated Apollinaris / but it doth not appeare there that he alone of hys owne authority dyd excommunicate hym. And there be great reaſons in that Chapter / to proue that he dyd it not of hys owne authority / for immediatly after his hereſy was knowne / Damaſus bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome / and Peter biſhop of Alexandria / cauſed a ſinode to be gathered at Rome / where hys hereſy was condemned. Now for ſo much as the cuſtome of

For proufe whereof I will geue you a place whych Ambroſe the beſt wytnes of thys matter hath in one of his epiſtles / wher he ſheweth that aſſone as the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whych Theodoſius had cauſed to be done at the citye of Theſſalonica was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 38.</note> heard / by and by the byſhops of Fraunce came and there was holden a Synode: where alſo Ambroſe ſayeth / that hys communicating wyth Theodoſius / coulde <note place="margin">Ambroſ. lib. de obitu Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſ.</note> not abſolue hym (for that as it myght appeare) the byſhops in that ſynode had in excommunicating hym / ordained that he ſhould not be abſolued vntill ſuche tyme as he had done repentance / whych he did afterward with confeſſyon of his faulte before the congregation / and aſking forgeuenes of it. So it appeareth that that whych he did / he did it by the ſentence of the ſynode / and not of hys owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity alone. In the. 220. &amp; 221. pages / he ſpeaketh of thys thing a freſh / but hath no newe matter / but maketh a bare reherſall of the places of the admonition / aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after hys accuſtomed manner of confuting / what maketh thys or what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that? only wheras he ſayd before / and proued (as he thought) that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had only to do wyth excommunication / being preſſed there / by the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either to defend or renounce hys Chauncellors. &amp;c. he had rather deny bothe the truth and himſelfe / then he wold haue any of that horrible confuſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the holy diſcipline of God (brought in by popery threatnyng the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of the whole church / &amp; ſeruing for nothing but for the nouriſhing of the ambition and idlenes of a fewe) driuen out of the church. Of the whych I will vpon occaſion ſpeake a word / if firſt I ſhewe that the vſe of the auncyent church hath bene not to permit the excommunication to one / but that the ſentence therof ſhould come from the gouernors and elders of the church / vnto whome that dyd eſpecially appertaine. Although I can not paſſe by that which M. doctor ſayth / that for ſo much as the authors of the Admonition had alledged the words (tell the church) to proue the intereſt of the church in excommunication / that therefore
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:21261:97"/> they could not vſe the ſame to proue the intereſt of the paſtor / as who ſhould ſaye that the paſtor is not one of the church. But of the abſurdity of this / I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſufficiently before / and how all men do ſee the vanity of thys reaſon / that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> people haue an intereſt by thys place / therfore the paſtor hath none. But I come to ſhew the vſe of the primitiue church in thys matter / wherof we haue a manifeſt teſtimony in Tertullian.

               <p>In Auguſtines tyme it appeareth alſo / that the conſent of the church was required / for in the third boke agaynſt the epiſtle of Parmenian / he ſheweth that if the multitude of the church be not in that fault for which one is to be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated / that then it helpeth much to make the party both afrayde and aſhamed / that he be excommunicated or anathematiſed (as he calleth it) by all the churche / and in hys bookes <hi>de Baptiſ. contra Donatiſtas,</hi> in diuers places / he is ſo far from permitting the excommunication to one man / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſemeth to fal into the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity / whych is to make the eſtate of the church to populare / and the people to haue too great a ſway. For there he ſheweth / that if the moſt of the people be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected wyth the fault whych is to be punyſhed by excommunication / that then no excommunication ought to be attempted / for becauſe a ſufficient numbre of voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will not be obtained for the excommunication. By whych teſtimonies / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes the inſtitution of God / &amp; the practiſe of the churches in the apoſtles times / appeareth manifeſtly what hath ben the vſe of the churches touchyng excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication / as long as there was any purity in the church. And it is to be obſerued heere / that bothe in thys parte of the diſcipline / and alſo in all other partes of it (as I haue ſhewed) as in harder and difficulter cauſes / thyngs were referred vnto the Synodes prouincial / nationall / or generall / as the caſe required: ſo if the elders of any church ſhall determine any thing contrary to the worde of God / or inconueniently in any matter that falleth into their determination / the partyes whych are greeued / may haue recourſe for remedy / vnto the elders and paſtoures of dyuers churches / that is to ſay vnto Synodes of ſhires / or dioceſes / or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces / or nations of as great or of as ſmall compaſſe as ſhall be thought conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient by the church / according to the difficulty or waight of the matters / whych are in controuerſy. Whych meetings ought to be as often as can be conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / not only for the deciſion of ſuche difficultyes whych the ſeuerall preſbyteries can not ſo well iudge of / but alſo to the ende that common counſell myght be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the beſt remeady of the vices or incommodities whych eyther the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be in / or in daunger to be in. And as thoſe thyngs whych can not be decided by the Elderſhyp of the churches are to be reſerued vnto the knowledge of ſome Synode of a ſhire or dioceſe: ſo thoſe whych for their hardneſſe can not be there decided / muſt be brought into the Synodes of larger compaſſe as I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to haue bene done in the apoſtles times / and in the churches whych followed them long after.</p>
               <p>Theſe thyngs ſtanding in thys ſorte / all thoſe Courtes of byſhoppes and archbyſhoppes muſt needes fall / whych were by Antichriſt erected againſt thys lawfull iuriſdiction of Elderſhip / as the courte of faculties / and thoſe whych are
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21261:98"/> holden by chauncellors / commiſſaries / officials / and ſuche lyke / the deſcribyng of the corruptions wherof / would require a whole boke / of whych I will note the principall heads and ſummes.</p>
               <p>Firſt / for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they enter into an offyce whych pertaineth not vnto them / but to euery particulare church / and eſpecially to the elderſhyp or gouernoures of the church / and therfore although they ſhould do nothing but that whych were good / lawfull / and godly / yet can they not approue their labors vnto men / much les to God / puttyng their ſickle in an other mannes harneſt. For neyther by the truthe of the worde of God dothe that appertayne vnto them / neyther by M. Doctors owne iudgement (if hys yea were yea / and hys nay nay) conſydering that he ſayd before / that thys iuriſdiction belongeth to the miniſters. And although it ſhould pertaine vnto the Byſhop / (as he is called) to whom notwythſtanding it dothe not appertaine) yet were it not lawfull for hym to tranſlate thys office vnto an other / and to appoynt one to doe it when he lyſteth / no more then he can appoynt them to doe hys other offyces of miniſtring / as preaching the worde / and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the ſacraments.</p>
               <p>An other thyng is / that in theſe courts (whych they cal ſpiritual) they take the knowledge of matters / which are meere ciuil / therby not only peruerting the order whych God hath appoynted / in ſeuering the ciuill cauſes from the eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall / but iuſtling alſo wyth the ciuill magiſtrate / and thruſting hym from the iuriſdiction / whych appertaineth vnto hym / as the cauſes of the contracts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage / of diuorces / of willes &amp; teſtaments / w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diuers ſuche other like things. For although it appertaine to the church and the gouernors therof / to ſhew out of the word of God whych is a lawfull contract or iuſt cauſe of diuorce / and ſo forthe / yet the iudiciall determination / and definitiue ſentences of all theſe / do appertaine vnto the ciuill magiſtrate. Heerevnto may be added / that all their puniſhments almoſt are penalties of mony / whych can by no meanes appertaine to the church / but is a thyng meerely ciuill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly / as they handle matters whych do not appertain vnto the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall iuriſdiction / ſo thoſe whych do appertaine vnto the church / they do turne from their lawfull inſtitution / vnto other ends not ſufferable / whych M. doctor hym ſelfe doth confeſſe in excommunicating for money. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all they take vpon them thoſe thyngs / whych are neyther lawful for ciuill nor eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction / nor ſimply for any man to doe / of whych ſorte diuers are reckened vp by the admonition / and ſame confeſſed by M. Doctor. I will not heere ſpeake of the vnfitnes of thoſe whych are chefe offycers in theſe courts / that the moſt of them are eyther papiſts / or bribers / or drunkardes / (I know what I wryte) or epicures and ſuch as liue of benefices and prebends in England or in Ireland / doing nothing of thoſe things whych appertaine vnto them / and of other ſuche naughty perſons whych are not only not meete to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors in the church / but whych in any reformed church / ſhoulde not be ſo much as of the church. I ſpeake not of all / I doubt not but there be ſome do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whych they do of conſcience / and with minde to healpe forwarde the Churche / whych I truſt will (when the Lorde ſhall giue them more knowledge) keepe them ſelues in their vocations / and being men for their giftes apte and able either to ſerue the Church or the common wealth in ſome other calling / will rather occupye theyr gifts there / then where they haue no grounde to aſſure them ſelues / that they doe pleaſe God. Now I will take a ſhort ſuruey of that whych M. doctor alleageth to proue his offices of maſter of faculties / chancellors. &amp;c. Firſt he ſayth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. 117 page out of the Ancyran councel / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were vicars of biſhops / wher although y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name be not fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cclors. &amp;c. yet there is (ſayth he) the office. What vicar ſ. Paules B. may haue / and in what caſe / I haue ſhewed before / where I haue proued the neceſſary reſidence of euery paſtor in his flock. But I will note heere
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21261:98"/> how M. Doctor both goe about to abuſe hys reader in theſe vicares. And firſt where there were three editions / of which one only maketh mention of theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cares he tooke that &amp; left the other / which is to be obſerued / for that thys varietie of editions roſe of the diuers vnderſtanding of the greke word <hi>(chorepiſcopos,)</hi> which may be taken eyther for hym that is byſhop for an other / and in hys place / or for hym that is byſhop in the country / that is in ſome towne which is no citie / ſo that <hi>chorepiſcopus,</hi> was oppoſed vnto the byſhop which was of ſome citie. And if it be ſo taken / then here is no proofe for the vicarſe of byſhoppes. But howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be / it ſhall appeare that the names of chauncelors and / <hi>chorepiſcopos,</hi> doe not ſo much differ / as the offices and functions of them. For it appeareth in the ſame Councell and Canon / that they were like the. 70. diſciples / that they had alſo ſome care to prouide for the poore / and that they were ſuch as dyd myniſter the ſacramentes. And in an other Councell / they haue authoritie geuen them to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antiochen. cap.</hi> 10.</note> make ſubdeacons / exorciſts / and readers. I know thys was a corruption of the myniſtery / but yet all men ſee / how Maiſter Doctor looketh as it were a farre of vpon things / and therefore taketh a man for a molehill / when he would make vs beleeue that theſe were chauncelors. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the. 125. page to the admonition deſyring that theſe may be remoued and the elderſhyp eſtablyſhed according to Gods order / M.

If therefore there be in euery church which feare God and keepe hys commaundementes / there are both wiſe and learned &amp; diſcrete men / and therefore not to be ſpoken of ſo contemptuouſly as M. Doctor ſpeaketh. And God be prayſed there are numbers in the church / that are hable to be teachers vnto moſt of the chauncelors / in any matter perteyning to the church / and are hable to geue a ryper iudgement in any eccleſiaſtical matter / then the moſt part of them can.</p>
               <p>And beſides that the choyſeſt are to be taken to thys office / thys ought not to be forgotten / that ſeeing good ſucceſſe of thinges depend vppon the bleſſing of God / and that bleſſing followeth the church when the Lordes order is kept / ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple men which carry no great countenaunce or ſhew / will vndoubtedly doe more good vnto the church / hauing a lawfull calling / then thoſe of great port whiche haue no ſuch calling.</p>
               <p>In the. 228. page he thinketh the Archbyſhoppes Courte neceſſary / but bringeth no reaſon / and further confeſſeth hym ſelfe ignoraunt of the eſtate of it / and therefore I know not from whence that good opynion of hys ſhoulde come / onleſſe it be from thence that he lyketh of all things be they neuer ſo euill whych the admonition miſſyketh. The reſt which M. D. hath of thys matter is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but great and high wordes.

                  <p>It was before ſhewed that of the gouernoures of the church / there were ſome
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21261:99"/> whoſe charge pertayned vnto the whole church / of the which we haue ſpoken: ſome other / whoſe charges extend but to a part of the church / that is vnto the poore / and theſe are the deacons. And as in the former part I ſhewed there were two kindes / ſo in this latter part y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame is to be noted / that of thoſe whoſe charge was ouer the poore / ſome had charge ouer all the poore of the church (as thoſe which are called deacons) ſome had charge ouer the poore ſtraungers / and thoſe poore which were ſicke only / and thoſe S. Paule calleth in one place Dyaconiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes / and in an other place widdowes. For the deacons dyd diſtribute vnto the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſyties as well of the poore ſtraungers and the ſicke poore / as vnto the other <note place="margin">16. Rom. 1. 1. Ti. 5. 10.</note> poore of the church. And the widdowes did employ their laboures to the waſhing of the feete of the ſtraungers / and attending vppon the poore which were ſicke / and had no frendes to keepe them. Firſt I will ſpeake of the deacons / &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as M. Doctor cryeth out of daiying with the ſcriptures / for alledging the. 8. verſe of the twelfth vnto the Romaines / to proue deacons / affirming that there is no worde of them: Truely I can fynde no wordes to ſet forth thys ſo groſſe ignorance. And had it not bene enough for M. Doctor to haue vttered thys ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance / but he muſt alſo with an outery proclayme it / and as it were ſpred the banner of it? What doe theſe wordes note (he that diſtributeth in ſimplicitie) but the office of the deaconſhyp. For in that place S. Paule reckeneth vp all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and perpetuall offices of the church / as the office of the doctor / of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor / of the deacon / of the elder / and leaueth not out ſo muche as the widdow / which he comprehendeth in theſe wordes (ſhewing mercy). If the authors of the Admonition doe daily with the ſcriptures in thys place / ſurely Maiſter Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin / M / Beza / M. Bucer / Peter Martyr. &amp;c. doe dally with them. And ſhall all theſe be eſteemed to play with the ſcriptures / and M. Doctor only to handle them ſeriouſly? And as M. Doctors ignorance appeareth in thys place / ſo hys mynde not deſirous of the truth / but ſecking to cauill / doth as manifeſtly ſhew it ſelfe. For all men ſee / that the admonition alledgeth not the place to the Teſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians to proue the office of deacons / but to ſhew that idle vagavondes might not haue any of that reliefe / which belongeth vnto thoſe which bee poore in deede / which thing appeareth both by the placing of the quotation ouer agaynſt that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation / &amp; by the letter which directeth therunto. And whereas M. Doctor ſayth / that the office of the deacons is not only to prouide for the poore / but alſo to preach and myniſter the ſacramentes / I haue ſhewed before / that it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne vnto them / to doe eyther the one or the other. For the proofe whereof / thys place of the Romaines quoted by the admonition / is very fit &amp; moſt proper. For S. Paule ſpeaketh there agaynſt thoſe which not contenting themſelues with their owne vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / dyd breake into that which appertayned vnto others / as if the hand ſhould take vpon it the office of the eye / or of ſome other member of the body / &amp; therfore S. Paule doth (as it were) bound &amp; point the limites of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry office in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church / &amp; ſo placeth the deacons office only in the preuyſion for the poore. Thys one thing I will adde to that matter / that if the apoſtles whiche hadde ſuche excellent and paſſing gyftes / dyd fynde them ſelues (preaching of the woorde / and attending to prayer) not able to prouyde for the poore / but thought it neceſſarye to dyſcharge them ſelues of that offyce / to the ende they myght doe the other effectually and fruitefully / hee that ſhall doe both now / muſt eyther doe none well and profitably / or elſe hee muſt haue greater giftes then the Apoſtles had.</p>
                  <p>The ſeconde poynt is touching that there were deacons in euery churche / which is well proued of the admonition / both by the place of the Phillippyans / and of the Actes / for although it be not there ſayd / that the deacons were in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry church / yet for ſo muche as the ſame vſe of them was in all churches which was in Ieruſalem &amp; at Philippos / and for that the Apoſtles (as hath bene before
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21261:99"/> touched) laboring after the vniformitie of the church / ordeyned the ſame officers in all churches / the proofe of one is the proofe of all / and the ſhewing that there were deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in one church / is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhewing in all. The place which they alledge out of the firſt to Timothe / is of all other moſt proper: for S. Paule there deſcribing not how the church of Epheſus / but ſimply and generally how the church muſt be gouerned / reckneth there the order of deacons. Whereunto may be added the contynuall practiſe of the church long after the Apoſtles times / which appeareth by the often ſuperſcriptions and ſubſcriptions in theſe words (the byſhop / elders / and deacons of ſuch a church / and vnto the byſhop / elders / and deacons of ſuch a church). And by that it is ſo often times ſayd in the councelles where the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches aſſembled / y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there were ſo many byſhops / ſo many elders / ſo many deacons.</p>
                  <p>The thirde poynt in thys deaconſhip is / whether it be a neceſſary office in the church / or for a tyme only / which controuerſy ſhoulde not haue bene / if M. Doctors engliſh tong had bene agreable with hys latin. For in a certayne latin pamphlet of hys / whereof I ſpake before / he maketh the deaconſhip a neceſſary office / and ſuch as ought not to be taken out of the church: here he ſingeth a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſong. There / becauſe he thought the neceſſitie of the deacon made for hym / he wold nedes haue deacons: here becauſe it maketh agaynſt hym he ſayth there is no neede of them / wherby appeareth how ſmall cauſe there is / that M. Doctor ſhould vpbrayde the authors of the admonition with mutability and diſcord with them ſelues. But that thys office is durable and perpetuall / it may appeare by that which I haue alledged before out of the ſixt of Timothe / for the neceſſitie of elders: for the argumentes ſerue to proue the neceſſitie of thoſe orders which are there ſet forth / whereof the deacon is one. And where as M. Doctor ſayth that euery church is not hable to fynde a curate (as he termeth hym) and a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con / I haue before ſhewed / intreating of the ſenyors / that the churches in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles tymes / might beſt haue ſayd thys / being poore and perſecuted / althoughe I ſee not why the church may not haue a deacon or deacons (if moe be needefull) with as ſmall charges as they may haue a collector or collectors.</p>
                  <p>There remayneth to ſpeake of the widdowes / which were godly poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the church aboue the age of. 60. yeares / for the auoyding of all ſuſpition <note place="margin">1. Timo. 5. 9.</note> of euill which might riſe by ſlaunderous tonges / if they had bene yonger. Theſe as they were noriſhed at the charges of the church being poore / ſo dyd they ſerue the church in attending vpon poore ſtrangers and the poore which were ſicke in the church / whereof they were widdowes. Now although there is not ſo great vſe of theſe widdowes with vs / as there was in thoſe places where the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were firſt founded / and in that tyme wherein thys order of widdowes was inſtituted / part of the which neceſſity grew both by the multitude of ſtraungers through the perſecution / &amp; by the great heate of thoſe eaſt countries / whereupon the waſhing &amp; ſupplyng of their feete was required: yet for ſo much as there are poore which are ſicke in euery church / I doe not ſee how a better and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient order can be deuiſed / for the attendance of them in their ſicknes &amp; other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities / then thys which S.

For if there be any ſuch poore widdowes of that age deſtitute of all friendes / it is manifeſt that they muſt needes liue of the charge of the church / &amp; ſeing they muſt nedes do ſo / it is better they ſhuld do ſome duety for it vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church agayne / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church ſhould be at a new charge to finde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to attend vpon thoſe which are ſicke &amp; deſtitute of keepers / ſeing that there can be none ſo fit for that purpoſe as thoſe women / which S.

I know y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there be lerned men which thinke otherwiſe / but I ſtand vpon the authoritie of Gods worde / and not vppon the

And if the matter alſo ſhoulde be tryed by the iudgement of men I am able to ſhew the iudgement of as learned as thys age hath brought forth / which thinketh that the inſtitution of widdowes is perpetuall / and ought to be where it may be had / and where ſuch widdowes are founde. In deede they are more rare now then in the Apoſtles tymes: For then by reaſon of the perſecution / thoſe which had the gift of continency / dyd ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne from mariage after the death of their huſbandes / for that the ſole lyfe was an eaſyer eſtate and leſſe daungerous and chargeable when they were driuen to flye / then the eſtate of thoſe which were maryed. Vnto all the reſt vntill the ende of the firſt part of the admonition I haue anſwered alredy. Yet there is a poynt or two / which I muſt touch wherof the firſt is in the. 126. page / where he would beare men in hand / that the authors of the admonition and ſome other of theyr mynde / would ſhut out the cyuill magiſtrate and the Prince / from all authoritie in Eccleſiaſtical matters / which ſurmiſe although I ſee it is not ſo much becauſe eyther he knoweth or ſuſpecteth any ſuch thing / as becauſe he meaneth heereby to lay a bayte to entrappe with all / thinking that where he maketh no conſcience to geue he careth not what authority to Princes / we will be loth to geue more then the word of God will permit / wherby he hopeth to draw vs into diſpleaſure with the Prince: yet for becauſe he ſhall vnderſtande / we noriſh no opynions ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly which we are aſhamed to declare openly / and for that we doubt not of the equitie of the prince in thys part / which knoweth that although her authoritie be the greateſt in the earth yet it is not infinite / but is lymitted by the word of God / and of whome we are perſwaded that as her maieſty knoweth / ſo ſhee will not vnwillingly heare the truth in thys behalfe / theſe things I ſay being conſidered / I anſwere in the name of the authors of the admonition / and thoſe ſome other which you ſpeake of / that the Prince and cyuill magiſtrate hath to ſee / that the lawes of God touching hys worſhippe / and touching all matters and orders of the church be executed &amp; dewly obſerued / &amp; to ſe that euery Eccleſiaſticall perſon do that office whereunto he is appoynted / and to puniſh thoſe which fayle in their office accordingly. As for the making of the orders &amp; cerimonyes of the church / they doe (where there is a conſtituted and ordered church) pertayne vnto the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the church and to the eccleſiaſtycall gouernoures / and that as they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with the making of cyuill lawes and lawes for the common wealth: ſo the cyuill magiſtrate hath not to ordayne cerimonies pertayning to the churche. But if thoſe to whome that doth appertayne / make any orders not meete / the magiſtrate may and ought to hynder them / and dryue them to better / for ſo much as the ciuill magiſtrate hath thys charge to ſee that nothing be done agaynſt the glory of God in hys domynion.</p>
                  <p>Thys diſtinction if M. Doctor knoweth not / nor hath not heard of / let him looke in the. 2. booke of the Chronicles / he ſhall ſee / that there were a number ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted <note place="margin">1.

The practiſe of thys he myght haue alſo moſt playnly ſeene in Ambroſe / who wold by no meanes ſuffer that the cauſes of the churches ſhould be debated in the Princes conſiſtory or court / but would haue them hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the church / by thoſe that had the gouernment of the church: and therefore excuſeth hym ſelfe to the emperour Valentinian / for that (being conuented to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of the church matters / vnto the ciuill court) he came not. And by whome can the matters and orders of the church bee better ordayned / then by the myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the church? And if that be a good reaſon of Maiſter Doctor in the fortie and ſeuenth page / that the Byſhoppes ought therefore to ordayne myniſters / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are beſt hable to iudge of the learning and habylitie / of thoſe which are the fytteſt / it is alſo as good reaſon / that therefore the myniſters and gouernours of the church ſhould appoynt and decree of ſuch ceremonyes and orders as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to the church / for becauſe it is to be ſuppoſed that they can beſt iudge of thoſe matters / beſtowing theyr ſtudyes that wayes / and further beſt vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the eſtate of the church about the which they are wholy occupyed. And this is not (Maiſter Doctor) to ſhake handes with the papiſtes. For the papiſtes would exempt their prieſtes from the ſubiection / and from the punyſhment of the cyuill magiſtrate / which we doe not. And the papiſtes would that whatſoeuer the cleargy doth determyne / that that forthwith ſhould be holden for good / and the Prince ſhould be forthwith compelled to mayntayne and ſet forth that / bee it good or euill / without further inquiry: but wee ſay that if there bee no lawfull myniſtery to ſet good orders (as in rumous decayes and ouerthrowes of relygi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that then the Prince ought to doe it: and if (when there is a lawfull myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery) it ſhall agree of any vnlawfull or vnmeete order / that the Prince ought to ſtay that order / and not to ſuffer it / but to driue them to that which is lawfull and meete. And if thys be to ſhake handes with the papiſtes / then Maiſter Doctor is to blame / which hath taught vs once or twiſe before / that the appoynting of ceremonies of the church / belongeth vnto the church. And yet I know that there is one or two of the later wryters / that thinke otherwiſe / but as I take no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage of their authoritie which thinke as I doe / ſo I ought not to be preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by thoſe / that thinke otherwiſe. But for ſo much as we haue M.

                  <p>The other poynt is in the hundreth thirty and eyght page / where hee moſt vntruely and ſlaunderouſly chargeth the authors of the Admonition / and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth wonderfull outcryes of them / as though they ſhould deny that there hadde beene any reformation at all / ſythens the tyme that the Queenes maieſtye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to raigne / manyfeſtly contrary / not onely to theyr meaning / but alſo to theyr very words / which appeareth in that they moue to a thorough reformation / &amp; to contende / or to labour to perfection / denying only that the reformation which hath bene made in her maieſties dayes / is thorough and perfect. We confeſſe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / that next vnto the Lorde God / euery one of vs is moſt deepely bounde vnto
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21261:101"/> her maieſty / whome he hath vſed as an excellent inſtrument to delyuer his church heere / out of the ſpirituall Egipt of popery / and the common wealth alſo / and the whole lande out of the ſlauery and ſubiection of ſtraungers / whereunto it was ſo neare: Thys I ſay we willingly confeſſe before men / and do in our prayers day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly geue moſt humble thankes to God therefore.</p>
                  <p>And by thys humble ſute and earneſt deſire whiche wee haue for further reformation / we are ſo far from vnthankfulnes vnto her maieſty / that we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deſire the heape of her felicitie / &amp; the eſtabliſhment of her royal throne amongſt vs / which then ſhall be moſt ſure and vnremoued / when our ſauiour Chriſt ſyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth wholy and fully / not only in hys chayre to teach / but alſo in hys throne to rule / not alone in the heartes of euery one by hys ſpirite / but alſo generally / and in the viſible gouernment of hys church by thoſe lawes of diſcipline / whiche hee hath preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>And whereas M.

And whereas he would priuely pinch at the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there / for ſo much as the Lord hath humbled the one / and exerciſeth the other by cyuill warres and troubles / he ſhould haue in ſteade of rocking vs a ſleepe in our ſecuritie / put vs in remembraunce of Gods ſcourges which hang ouer vs / and of Gods great pacience that ſtill taryeth for our repentaunce / and that if hee haue punyſhed that people of hys which haue ſuffered ſo much for the profeſſion of the Goſpell / and which went with ſo ſtrayght a foote in it / with an vniuerſall hazarde of their goodes and lyues / that wee ſhall not eſcape vnleſſe wee repent ſpedely of our coldnes and halting in relygion / and vnwillingnes / I will not ſay to hazarde to put our lyues in daunger / but not to leeſe ſome of our wealth and honor / for the obtayning of a through reformation of the churche / and aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the glory of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Finally / he would rather haue put vs in remembrance of the ſermon which our ſauiour Chriſt maketh / where he ſheweth that thoſe cyties are not alwares <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 2. &amp;c.</note> the greateſt ſinners / or thoſe whome God is moſt angry with / which haue the heauieſt iudgementes executed vpon them / but that thereby the Lord calleth vs to repentance / otherwyſe that we ſhall lykewiſe peariſh.

In all the reſt / M.

               <p>THe Admonition hath no ſuch thing / as M. Doctor chargeth the authors thereof with / that they dyd euer allow of the booke of ſeruice. It ſayeth they bare with it / and vſed it ſo farre / as they might / and therefore now when it came to the approuing of it by ſubſcription / they refuſed / &amp; there is no man which can not vnderſtand / that it is one thing to beare with a thing / and an other to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it / and therefore to beare / and to vſe it ſo farre as might be / may well agree with their refuſall of ſubſcription / ſo that M. Doctors note is not worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The Apoſtles dyd beare with the infirmitie of the Iewes addicted to the obſeruation of the ceremoniall law / yet they neuer alowed that infirmitie / and they were ſo farre from approuing it by ſubſcribing / that they wrote agaynſt it. Thoſe (ſayth M. D. which authorized thys booke / were ſtudious of peace / and of building of Chriſtes church / therefore they that ſpeake agaynſt it (which hee
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21261:102"/> calleth defacing) are diſturbers of the peace / and deſtroyers of the church. So I will reaſon: Gedeon was ſtudious of peace / and of building of the churche / therefore they whiche ſpake agaynſt the Ephod which he made / were diſturbers of the peace / and deſtroyers of the church. We ſpeake agaynſt images in chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches / and conſubſtantiation in the ſacramentes / and ſuch lyke / which Luther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtudious of peace / and of the building of the church dyd holde / and yet we are not therfore diſturbers of peace / or deſtroyers of the church. Although they were excellent perſonnages / yet their knowledge was in part / &amp; although they brought many things to our light / yet they being ſent out in the morning / or euer the ſunne of the goſpell was ryſen ſo hygh / might ouerſee many things which thoſe that are not ſo ſharpe of fight / as they were / may ſee / for becauſe that which they want in the ſharpnes of ſight / they haue by the benefite and cleareneſſe of the ſun and of the light. They ſealed not the booke of ſeruice with their bloud (as M. Doctor ſayeth) for ſome that ſuffred for the truth / declared openly theyr myſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of certayne thinges in it / and as for the other they coulde neuer dye for that booke / more then for the lyturgie vſed in the Frenche churche / or at Geneua. For they receiued not the ſentence of condemnation / becauſe they approued that booke / but becauſe they improued the articles drawne out of the maſſe booke. And if they had dyed for that booke (as in deede they dyed for the booke of God) yet the authoritie of theyr martyrdome / coulde not take away from vs thys lyberty that we haue to enquire of the cauſe of theyr death. Iuſtin and Cyprian were godly martyrs / &amp; yet a man may not ſay / that they ſealed their errors which they wrote with theyr bloud / or with thys glory of their martyrdome / preiudice thoſe which ſpeake or wryte agaynſt their erroures: for thys is to oppoſe the bloud of men / to the bloud of the ſonne of God.

The place vnto the Corinthes / is the ſame vnto the Romanes / and M. Doctor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing one / hath no cauſe to fynde fault with the other. For the homylies firſt of all I haue ſhewed / how abſurde a ſaying / and how vnlyke a dyuine it is / to match reading of homylies / with preaching of ſermons. For if the reading of the holy ſcriptures is nothing ſo fruitefull as the preaching of them / muche leſſe is the reading of homylies to be for their frute matched with preaching of ſermons. There remayneth that I ſhew briefely / that neyther the homylies nor the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chripha / are at all to be red in the churche. Wherein firſt it is good to conſider the order which the Lorde kept with hys people in tymes paſt / when he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Exod. 30. 29.</note> that no veſſell / nor no inſtrument eyther beeſome / or fleſh hooke / or pan. &amp;c. ſhuld come into the temple / but thoſe only which were ſanctifyed / &amp; ſette apart for that vſe. And in the booke of Numbers / he will haue no other trumpets blowne <note place="margin">Numb. 10. 2.</note> to cal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people together / but thoſe only which were ſet apart for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> purpoſe. What ſhould the meaning of thys law be? The matter of other common veſſels &amp; trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets / was the ſame oftentimes which theirs was / the ſame forme / alſo &amp; the other beeſomes and hookes / and trumpets hable to ſerue for the vſes of ſweeping and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21261:102"/> ſounding. &amp;c. as well as thoſe of the temple / and as thoſe which were ſet aparte / wherfore mought not theſe then as well be vſed in the temple as others? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſothe / becauſe the Lord would by theſe rudiments and pedagogie teache / that he would haue nothing brought into the church / but that which he had appoynted / no not althoughe they ſeemed in the iudgement of men / as good as thoſe things which God him ſelfe had placed there. Which thing is much more to be obſerued in this matter / ſeeing that the homilies red (be they neuer ſo learned and pithye) neyther the Apochrypha / are to be compared either in goodnes within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues / eyther in frute or in effect towardes the hearer / wyth the authenticall ſcriptures of God.

               <p>Beſides thys / the pollicy of the church of God in times paſt is to be folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herein / that for the expounding of darker places / places of more eaſines ought to be ioyned together / as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antiochus / wher they could not haue the commodity of preaching / the Iewes dyd appoynt at their meetings alwayes a peece of the law to be red / &amp; with all a peece of the prophets whych expounded y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> peece of the lawe / rather then to bring in interpretations of men to be red. And becauſe I am entred into that matter / heere cometh to be conſidered the practiſe alſo of the church both before our ſauior Chriſtes comming / and after / that when <note place="margin">Actes. 13. 15. Actes. 15. 21.</note> the churches met together / there is nothing mentioned but the reading of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures / for ſo is the Lyturgie deſcribed in the Actes. And it is not to be thought / but that they had thoſe whych made expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the law and the prophets. And beſydes that / they had Onkelos the Calday paraphraſt / bothe Galatine / &amp; Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Moſes (ſurnamed Maymon) write / that Ionathan an nother of the Calday paraphraſts floryſhed in oure ſauyor Chriſtes tyme / whoſe wrytings and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes vpon the ſcryptures / are eſtemed comparable in that kinde of paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall wryting / wyth any whych hath laboured that wayes. And if any mennes wrytings were to be red in the church / thoſe paraphraſes whych in explanyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrypture / go leaſt from it / and whych kepe not only the numbre of ſentences / but almoſt the very numbre of words / were of all moſt fitte to be red in the churche. Seeing therfore (I ſay) the church of God then abſtained from ſuch interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the church / and contented it ſelfe wyth the ſcryptures / it can not be but a moſte dangerous attempt / to bryng any thyng into the church to be red beſydes the word of God. Thys practiſe continued ſtill in the churches of God after the apoſtles times / as may apeare by the ſecond Apologie of Iuſtin Martyr / which ſheweth that theyr manner was to read in the church the monuments of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and of the apoſtles / and if they had red any thyng elſe / it is to be ſuppoſed that he would haue ſet it downe / conſydering that hys purpoſe there / is to ſhewe the whole order whych was vſed in their churches then. The ſame may appear in the firſt Homilye of Oregine vpon Exodus / and vpon the Iudges. And as for M. Bucers authoritye / I haue ſhewed before how it ought to be wayghed / &amp; heere alſo it is ſuſpitious: for that it is ſayd that hys aduiſe was / when the lord ſhould bleſſe the realme wyth moe learned preachers / that then order ſhould be taken to make more homilyes / whych ſhould be red in the church vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: As if M. Bucer dyd not know / that there were then learned preachers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the realme / whych were able to make homilies / ſo many as the volume of them myght eaſely haue exceeded the volume of the Byble / if the multytude
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:21261:103"/> of homilyes would haue done ſo much good. And if the authority of M. Bucer beare ſo great a ſway wyth M. Doctor / that vpon hys credite only wythout ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcripture or reaſon / or examples of the Churches primitiue / or thoſe whych are now / he dare thruſt into the church homilies / then the authorities of the moſt ancient &amp; beſt councels ought to haue ben conſidered / whych haue geuen charge / that nothyng ſhould be red in the church / but only the canonicall ſcriptures. For it was decreed in the councell of Laodicea / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nothing ſhuld be red in the church / <note place="margin">59. <hi>can. concil. Laod. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>concil. Conc.

                  </note> but the canonicall bokes of the olde and newe teſtament / and reckeneth vp what they be. Afterward as corruptions grew in the church / it was permitted that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies myght be red by the deacon / when the miniſter was ſicke / and coulde not preach / and it was alſo in an other councel of Carthage permitted / that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs liues might be red in the church. But beſides the euill ſucceſſe that thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees had (vnder pretence wherof the popiſhe legende / and Gregories homilies. &amp;c. crept in) that vſe and cuſtome was controlled by other councels / as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Colen / albeit otherwyſe popiſhe. And truely if there were <note place="margin">4. <hi>Tom. concil.</hi> 6. <hi>c. concil. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. parte.</hi> 2.</note> nothing elſe but thys conſideration / that the bringing in of the reading of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs liues into the church / and of the homilies of auncient wryters / hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thys meanes iuſtled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Bible / but alſo thruſt it cleane out of the church / or into a corner where it was not redde nor ſeene / it ought to teach all men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of placing any wryting or worke of men in the church of God / be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo well learned / as long as the world ſhould endure.</p>
               <p>And if any man obiect / that by thys meanes alſo is ſhut out of the churche the forme of ordinary prayers to be ſayd: I ſay the caſe is nothing lyke / for when we pray we can not vſe the words of the ſcripture / as they orderly lie in the text. But for ſo muche as the churche prayeth for diuers thyngs neceſſarye for it / the whych are not contained in one or two places of the ſcripture / and that alſo there are ſome thyngs whych we haue neede of / whereof there is no expreſſe prayer in the ſcripture: it is needefull / that there be a forme of Prayer drawne forthe out of the ſcrypture / whych the church may vſe when it meeteth / as the occaſyon of the time dothe require / whych neceſſity can not be by no meanes alledged in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Homilies or Apochrypha. Wherevpon appeareth that it is not ſo wel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the churche of Englande / where bothe Homilies and Apochrypha are red / eſpecially when as diuers chapters of the bookes called Apocrypha / are lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp ſo high / that they are ſometime appoynted for extraordinary leſſons vpon feaſtes dayes / wherin the greateſt aſſemblies be made / and ſome of the chapters of the canonicall ſcripture (as certen chapters of the Apocalipſe) quite left oute and not red at all.</p>

               <p>TEll me M. doctor why there ſhould be any ſuch confirmation in the church / being brought in by the fained Decretall Epiſtles of the Popes / and no one tittle therof being once found in the ſcrypture / and ſeeing that it hath bene ſo horribly abuſed / and not neceſſary / why ought it not to be vtterly abolyſhed? and thirdly / thys confirmation hath very dangerous poynts in it.

               <p>LEaſt M. Doctor (as hys common faſhyon is when the corruption of anye thyng is ſpoken agaynſt) ſay that we condemne buryall / I would haue hym vnderſtand / that we hold that the body muſt be honeſtly and comely buried / and that it is mete / that for that cauſe ſome reaſonable numbre of thoſe whych be the frends and neyghbors about / ſhould accompany the corps to the place of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryall. We hold it alſo lawfull to lament the dead / and if the dignity of the perſone ſo require / we thynke it not vnlawfull to vſe ſome way about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> buriall / wherby that may appeare / but yet ſo / that there be a meaſure kepte bothe in the weepyng and in the charges / conſydering that whereas immoderate eyther weepyng or pompe was neuer / no not in the tyme of the lawe allowed / nowe in the time of the goſpell / all that is not lawfull / whych was permitted in the time of the law. For vnto the people of God vnder the law / weeping was by ſo much more permitted vnto them / then vnto vs / by howe muche they had not ſo cleare a reuelation and plaine ſyght of the reſurrection as we haue / whych was y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cauſe alſo why it was lawfull for them to vſe more coſt in the embaulmyng of the dead / therby to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhe and to helpe their hope touchyng the reſurrection / wherof we haue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pledge by the reſurrection of our ſauyor Chriſt / then they had. Nowe for the thyngs whych the admonition findeth fault wyth / and thereof bryngeth reaſon / M. Doctor of hys bare credite wythout any reaſon or ſcrypture / or any thyng els / commendeth them vnto vs / &amp; ſayeth they be good. And thys you ſhall marke to be M. doctors ſymple ſhyft throughoute hys booke / that when he hath no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loure of ſcripture / nor of reaſon / no name nor title of doctor / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make vp ſome thyng / he varyeth hys affirmation by all the figures he can / as in ſaying ſimplye that it is ſo / and then in aſkyng whether it be not ſo / and after in aſkyng whether there is any other man will thynke that it is not ſo / as if the woulde make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue / that he ſetteth vs dyuers kindes of meates / becauſe he bryngeth the ſame in dyuers dyſhes. For beſydes theſe reaſons / he hathe no reaſon / eyther to proue that it is meete to haue preſcript forme of ſeruice for the dead / or that the miniſter ſhould be drawne to thys charge. Surely if the order be ſo good and conuenient / it hath met w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a very barren patron / whych can ſay nothing for it. And although there be enough ſayd by the admonition / yet becauſe thys bold and hardy ſpeache is enough to lead the ſimpler away / &amp; to make them thinke that M. doctor hathe a good cauſe / therfore I wil alſo ſay ſomthyng of theſe rites of buryal.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all / as thys almoſt is a generall fault in them all / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne in the mindes of the ignorant the opinion of praying for the dead: ſo is thys alſo a nother general fault / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe ceremonyes are taken vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any example / either of the churches vnder the law / or of the pureſt churches vnder the goſpel / that is / of the churches in the apoſtles times. For when the ſcripture deſcrybeth the ceremonies or rites of buryall amongſte the people of God ſo dilygently / that it maketh mention of the ſmalleſt thyngs / there is no doubte but the holy Ghoſte doth therby ſhew vs a paterne / wherevnto we ſhould alſo frame oure buryalles. And therfore for ſo much as neyther the church vnder the law nor vnder the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell / when it was in the greateſt puritye / dyd euer vſe any preſcript forme of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:21261:104"/> in the buryall of theyr dead / it coulde not be but daungerous / to take vp any ſuch cuſtome / &amp; in the tyme of the lawe it was not only not vſed / but vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. For when the law did forbyd that the prieſt ſhould not be at the buryall / <note place="margin">Leu. 21. 1. 11.</note> which ought to ſay or conceiue the prayers there / it is cleare y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Iewes might not haue any ſuch preſcript form. And yet they had moſt nede of it / for the cauſes of obſcure knowledge / &amp; weaker fayth before alledged. Againe / by thys meanes a newe charge is layd vpon the miniſter / and a taking hym away from his neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dueties of feeding and gouerning the flocke / whych being ſo great as a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous diligence will ſcarcely ouercome / oughte not to be made greater by thys / being a thyng ſo vnneceſſary. The Admonition dothe not ſay that the Prayers whych are ſayd / are for the dead / but that they maintaine an opinion of prayer for the deade in the heartes of the ſimple / and that they declare manifeſtly enoughe / when they ſay that it may be partly gathered. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the mournyng apparell / the admonition ſayeth not ſimply it is euill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is done of cuſtome / but proueth that it is hypocritical ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times / for that it proceedeth not from any ſadnes of minde / whych it dothe pretende / but worne only of cuſtome / there being vnder a mourning gowne of tentimes a mery heart. And conſidering that where there is ſorow in deede for the dead / there it is very hard for a man to kepe a meaſure that he do not lament too much: We ought not to vſe thoſe meanes whereby we myght be further prouoked to ſorow / and ſo go a great way beyonde the meaſure / whych the apoſtle apoynteth in mournyng / no <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4. 13.

Seing therefore if there be no ſorowe / it is hypocritical to pretend it / and if there be / it is very dangerous to prouoke it / or to cary the notes of reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of it / it appeareth that this vſe of mourning apparel were much better layed away then kept. And here M. doctor threps a litle kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the authors of the admonition / &amp; ſayth that they know it is very ancient / whom before he denyeth to haue any knowledge of antiquity.

               <p>Nowe touching the funerall ſermons M. doctor taketh on / &amp; tryumpheth maruellouſly / as though he had already gotten the victorye: but he that girdeth hys harnes / ſhould not boaſt as he that putteth it of. There is more matter then peraduenture M. doctor is aware of / &amp; that whych is ſet downe / he anſweareth not: as that it noryſheth an opinion that the dead are the better for it / whych doth appeare in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there are none more deſirous of funerall ſermons / then the papiſts / whych although they can not abide the doctrine whych is preached / yet they wil haue ſuche ſermons / and thoſe whych will very ſeldome / or not at all / be at other ſermons / will not commonly miſſe one of theſe. Furthermore / for ſo much as the minyſter is driuen oftentimes by this meanes to preach vpon a ſodaine / the word of God therby is negligently handled / eſpecially of thoſe whoſe gyftes are not ſo great / as that they can prouide in ſo ſmall time / and by thys neglygent handlyng of the word of God / it is brought into contempt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer / conſydering that theſe funerall ſermons are at the requeſt of rych men / and thoſe whych are in authoritye / and are very ſeldome at the buryall of the pore / there is brought into the church (contrary to the word of God) an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of perſons / which ought not to be. For although the miniſter may giue to one more honor then to an other / accordyng as the callyng or degree requireth / yet in hys myniſtery / &amp; that whych pertaineth vnto hys office / he ought to ſhew hymſelfe indifferent / and therfore preach as wel at the death of the pore / as of the rych: and becauſe he can not well do both / it is moſt conuenient to leaue both. If
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21261:105"/> ſo be that M. doctor wyl ſay / that it is good that notable and famous men ſhuld haue their commendation / to the ende that bothe the goodnes of God towardes them / myght be the better knowne / and others the ſoner drawne to followe theyr example: I graunt it is ſo / and the ſcrypture dothe bothe approue it / and ſheweth what meane is beſt to doe that by. For ſo we read that Ieremy the prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that godly and zealous prince Ioſias / in wryting verſes of hys deathe. <note place="margin">2. Chro. 35. 25</note> He could haue as eaſely preached / but thys he thought the beſt way. So did alſo Dauid wryte verſes at the death of Saul / and Ionathan and Abner / in whych <note place="margin">2. Sa. 1. 17. &amp;c. 2. Sa. 3. 33. &amp;c</note> he commendeth their gyfts and graces whych the Lord had beſtowed vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There were in deede of ancient time funerall orations / as appeareth in Gregory Nazianzen / but they ſauoured of the manner of Athens / where he was brought vp: where alſo thys cuſtome of funerall orations was vſed / as may be ſeene in the ſecond boke of Thucydydes ſtory by an oration of Pericles. And althoughe thys cuſtome was not in Nazianzeus time / ſo corrupt as afterwardes: yet the departing from the examples of the purer churches / gaue occaſion of further cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption whych enſued. And to ſay the truth / it was better vſed amongſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians / then amongſt the chriſtians. For there it was merely ciuill / and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the death of ſome notable perſonage / made / not by a miniſter / but by an Orator appoynted therfore: whych I thinke may well be done. And if M. doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor will ſay / that there myght be ſermones / although they be not mentioned ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the old teſtament nor in the new: I haue anſwered before / that ſeeing the holy ghoſt doth deſcribe ſo dilygently the leaſt circumſtances of burial / he would not haue omitted that / being the greateſt. And let it be obſerued / that thys deuiſe of mannes braine bryngeth forth the ſame frute that other do / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is / dryueth quite away a neceſſary duety of the miniſter / whych is / to comfort wyth the worde of God / the parties whych be greued at the death of their frends / that conſideryng the ſore is perticular / he apply vnto it a perticular plaiſter whych is very ſeldome or neuer done / and yet a neceſſary duety / as of a good chriſtian / ſo eſpecially of the miniſter / whych can beſt do it / and to whome it moſt appertaineth. And whereas M. doctor aſketh / when there is a better time to ſpeake of death and of mortality then at buryall / ſurely if it had ben ſo fit / the Prophets and apoſtles would neuer haue loſt that oportunity / or let pas that occaſion of aduancing and making effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall their preaching. What if it be anſwered / that for as muche as oure lyfe is a continuall meditation of death / it is not ſalfe to vſe thys cuſtome / for that it tyeth our cogitation to ſo ſhort a tyme as the tyme of buryall is / which ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the whole courſe of our lyfe. But I anſwere / that it may be well done wythout any ſuch funerall ſermons when the miniſter taketh occaſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of any whych is lately departed / to ſpeake of the vanity of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life of man. Whether M. doctor lyketh the reformation or no / ſo it is in the church where M. Caluin was paſtor / &amp; hath ben for theſe many yeres. And although the Engliſhe church in Geneua had that in the boke of common prayer / yet (as I haue heard of thoſe whych were there preſent) it was not ſo vſed. And if it had bene / yet therby it is not proued that M. Caluin allowed of it. For wyth thyngs wherin ther was no great and manifeſt diſorder / M. Caluin dyd beare that whych he lyked not of. And there being no papiſts in all the city / and al being wel inſtructed / there was no ſuch danger in a funerall ſermon there / as is here amongſt vs / where there is many papiſts / and mo ignorant. I will ſay nothyng of the great abuſe of thoſe / whych hauing otherwyſe to lyue on of the church / take nobles for euery ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon / and ſometime a mourning gowne / whych cauſeth the papiſtes to open their mouthes wide / and to ſay / that the marchandiſe of ſermons is much dearer then of the maſſe: for that they might haue for a grote or ſix pence / and the ſermon they cannot haue vnder a rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſum. That muſt be remembred whych I had almoſt forgotten / howe vntruely and ſlaunderouſly M. doctor ſayth / that the authors of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21261:105"/> the admonition do compare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſermon wyth a trentall or a maſſe. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſay in ſtead of the maſſe we haue the holy Communion / doe I compare / or lyken the communion to the maſſe? and yet this is M. doctors charitable collection / which gathereth thyngs whych no man letteth fall. Touching the place of buryall / I haue ſpoken before. And although it be not to be miſlyked / that there ſhould be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon place to bury in / yet the places whych M. doctor poynteth vs vnto / proue the cleane contrary. For by the ſtory of Abrahams place of buryall / it appeareth that the manner was that euery one was buryed in hys owne ſeuerall grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d / as may appeare alſo by that that the euangeliſt ſayth / that there was a field bought <note place="margin">Math. 27. 7.</note> to bury the ſtrangers in / whych had no place of their owne / whych was alſo vſed ſometimes in the churches vnder the goſpell / as appeareth by the ſtory of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret / whych I haue before recited / &amp; in the later end of a funeral oratien / which Gregory Nazianzene made of the death of hys brother Ceſarius. And ſo by this reaſon M. doctor wold haue euery one buryed in hys owne poſſeſſion.</p>

               <p>And where M.

               <p>And as for the reaſons which M. doctor bringeth to eſtabliſhe them in the 225. page / as that they are neceſſary (whych he doth barely ſay) and that ſ.

For whatſoeuer commeth from the Pope which is Antichriſt / commeth firſt from the deuill: and where he addeth thys conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (if it be good. &amp;c.) in deede if of the egges of a cockatrice can be made holeſome meate to feede with / or of a ſpiders webbe any cloth to couer with all / then alſo may the things that come from the Pope and the Deuill / be good / profitable / and neceſſary vnto the church. And where he ſayeth that collegiate churches are of great auncientie / he proueth not the auncientie of the cathedrall churches / onles he proue that cathedrall and collegiate be all one. But I will not ſticke wyth hym for ſo ſmall a matter / &amp; if our controuerſy were of the names of theſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:21261:106"/>
/ and not of the matter / I could be content to graunt hys cauſe in this poynt as good as antiquitie without the word of God (which is nothing but rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) could make it. But for ſo much as thoſe auncient collegiate churches were no more lyke vnto theſe which we haue now / then things moſt vnlyke: our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall churches haue not ſo much as thys olde worne cloke of antiquity / to hide theyr nakednes / and to keepe out the ſhoure. For the collegiate churches in times paſt were a ſenate Eccleſiaſticall / ſtanding of godly learned myniſters &amp; elders / which gouerned and watched ouer that flocke which was in the citie or towne where ſuche churches were / and for that in ſuche great cities and townes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly there were the moſt learned paſtors and auncientes / therefore the townes and villages rounde about in hard and difficult cauſes / came and had their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of theyr doubtes at theyr handes: euen as alſo the Lord commaunded in Deuteronomie / that when there was any great matter in the countrey / which <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 8. 9.</note> the Leuites in matters pertayning to God / and the Iudges in matters pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the common wealth / could not diſcuſſe / that then they ſhould come to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem / where there was a great numbre of Prieſtes / Leuites / and learned Iudges / of whome they ſhould haue their queſtions diſſolued / and thys was the firſt vſe of collegiate churches. Afterward the honor which the ſmaller churches gaue vnto them / in aſking them counſell / they tooke vnto them ſelues / and that which they had by the curteſy and good will proceeding of a reuerent eſtimation of them / they dyd not only take vnto them of right / but alſo poſſeſſed them of all authority of hearing and determyning any matters at all. And in the ende they came to thys which they are now / which is a company that haue ſtrange names and ſtrange offyces / vnhearde of of all the purer churches / of whome the greateſt good that wee can hope of is / that they doe no harme. For although there be dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers which doe good / yet in reſpect that they bee Deanes / Prebendaries / Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons / Petycanons. &amp;c. for my part / I ſee no profite but hurte come to the church by them.</p>
               <p>And where hee ſayeth they are rewardes of learning / in deede then they ſhould be / if they were conuerted vnto the mayntenance and bringing vp of ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers / where now for the moſt part / they ſerue for fat morſels to fill (if it might be) the gredy appetites of thoſe / which otherwyſe haue enough to lyue with / and for holes and dennes to keepe them in / which eyther are vnworthy to be kept at the charge of the church / or elſe whoſe preſence is neceſſary and duetifull in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / and for the moſt part vnprofitable there.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all / whereas M. Doctor ſayeth that we haue not to follow other churches / but rather other churches to follow vs / I haue anſweared before / thys only I adde / y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they were not counted only falſe Prophets which taught corrupt doctryne / but thoſe which made the people of God beleeue / that they were happy when they were not / and that their eſtate was very good / when it was corrupt.

               <p> THe places alledged by the Admonition to proue that myniſters of the church may not intermeddle with ciuill functions (one only excepted) are well and fitly alledged: and moſt of them vſed to that ende of wryters / which if I ſhould name / all would confeſſe / that they are ſuch / as with whome M. Doctor is not worthy to be ſo much as ſpoken of the ſame day.</p>
               <p>For the firſt place / if ſo be that the myniſter ought rather to leaue neceſſary <note place="margin">9. Luk. 60. 61</note> dueties of burying hys father / &amp; ſaluting hys frends vndone / then that he ſhoulde not accomplyſh hys miniſtery to the full: much more he ought not to take vpon hym thoſe thinges / which are not only not neceſſary dueties / but as it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare / doe in no caſe belong vnto hym. And although it may be applyed to all Chryſtians / yet it doth moſt properly belong vnto the myniſters. And as for the other place of Luke / touching our ſauyoure Chryſtes refuſall to deuide the <note place="margin">12. Luke. 14.</note> inheritaunce betweene the brethren / it is moſte aptly alledged to thys purpoſe. For althoughe our ſauioure Chriſte doth not there take away from men / autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to iudge / yet hee ſheweth thereby ſufficiently / that it belongeth not vnto the miniſters of the worde / to intermeddle in the iudgement of cyuil cauſes. For our ſauioure Chriſt framed that anſwere / hauing reſpect to the boundes of his calling.</p>
               <p>For as he being a Miniſter of the Goſpell / dyd all thoſe things which were pertayning to hys myniſtery: So by refuſing thys office of iudgement in cyuill cauſes / he gaue to vnderſtand that it did not appertayne vnto the compaſſe of that office / which he exerciſed / which was the miniſtery. And therfore it is altogether out of ſeaſon that M. D. here alledgeth / that the Anabaptiſtes vſe thys reaſon to proue that chriſtians may not haue magiſtrates. For how doth thys follow / that becauſe thys place of S. Luke proueth not / that we ought to haue no chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an magiſtrates: that therfore it proueth not / that the miniſter ſhould be no magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate / as if there coulde bee no ciuill magiſtrates / onleſſe miniſters of the worde were.</p>
               <p>And the place which he alledgeth out of the learned man / doth not only not make any thing for hym / but doth quite ouerthrow hys cauſe. For he ſayeth that our ſauiour Chriſt dyd not refuſe thys as a thing in it ſelfe vnlawfull / but becauſe it dyd not agree with hys vocation. Now the vocation of our ſauiour Chriſt / was to be a myniſter of the goſpell / therefore it doth not agree with the vocation of a myniſter of the goſpell to iudge or to entermeddle in cyuill gouernment. And if M. Doctor had bene ſo ſtudious of M. Caluins works / as by hys often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of hym / he woulde make the world beleue / he might haue * red in hym <note place="margin">4. <hi>li. Inſt.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi>
                  </note> thys ſentence cited for thys purpoſe / to proue that the miniſters haue not to doe with ciuill things. Furthermore M. D. aſketh what S. Paules place to the Romanes (where he willeth that he which hath an office / muſt waite of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <note place="margin">12. Rom. 7.</note> he that teacheth of his teaching) maketh to thys purpoſe. Surely M. Doc. very much. Neither can there be a place more properly alledged / both for the very playnes of the words / &amp; alſo for the circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the place. For S. Paule ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth there agaynſt thoſe / which would ouerreach their callings / &amp; hauing certeine callings / contented not them ſelues with them / but woulde haue an ore in euery mans boate / and would take more vpon them then they were able to doe / or the meaſure of theyr giftes would ſtretch vnto. And therefore ſheweth / that as the body is beſt preſerued when euery member thereof doth hys office / and deſtroyed when one member will take vpon it to do the office of an other: ſo the church is then beſt gouerned / when euery Eccleſiaſticall perſon keepeth hym ſelfe within the limits of hys calling / not medling with that which pertayneth vnto an other. But M. Doctor ſayeth that the byſhoppe gouerneth as well by diſciplyne as by preaching: ſo he doth. But I pray you by what dyſciplyne? what a reaſon is thys / he gouerneth by diſcipline / <hi>ergo,</hi> by ciuill diſciplyne. You ſay in the next ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:21261:107"/> that the authors of the admonition either dote or dreame: But if theſe be your ſharpe diſputations / when you are awake? ſurely they are very blunt when you dreame. But I had rather iudge the beſt / that Maiſter Doctor was ouer-watched.</p>
               <p>The laſt place which is alledged by the admonition / is out of the epiſtle to Tim. <note place="margin">2. Epiſt. 2. 4.</note> where it ſheweth / that for ſo much as the eſtate of a miniſter / is as that of a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier / &amp; therfore as the ſouldyer / to the end he myght the better pleaſe hys captaine / &amp; doe hys ſeruice of warfare / quitteth all thoſe things which he loueth / &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of otherwyſe he might haue care / and might enioy: euen ſo the myniſter ought to diſpatch hym ſelfe of all thoſe things which may be any let to the office of hys my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery / although he might otherwiſe lawfully vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if ſo be for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſtery to the full / he muſt quite thoſe things which he may lawfully vſe / how much more might the admonition conclude that he ought not to entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle himſelfe with thoſe things / which (out of the places of S. Luke / and to the Romaines) it had ſhewed to be vnlawfull for hym to meddle with? And although M. D. ſay the ſentence be generall / yet it is particularly ment / and moſt properly of the myniſters / which Maiſter Caluin teacheth M. Doctor in the ſame place / where he hath cited hys authoritie twiſe to no purpoſe. For what although M. Caluin doe not there apply in preſcript words thys ſentence to proue that myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought not to meddle with cyuill offices / doth it follow therefore that thys place can not be vſed thereto? In ſaying that he ought to abſtayne from all lets which may hinder his vocation &amp; miniſtery / he doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently ſay / that he ought to abſtayne from all ciuill offices. And if ſo be M. Doct. had bene ſo well red in the auncient doctors (as he would ſeeme) he might haue knowen that thys place is vſed of * Cyprian / to the ſame purpoſe that it is alledged heere. For Cyprian <note place="margin">9. <hi>ep.</hi> 1. <hi>lib. e.</hi>
                  </note> ſpeaking agaynſt an elder which had taken vpon him to be executor to one which was dead / alledgeth thys place. To theſe reaſons of the admonition / may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that which the admonition hath in the. 230. page / that the regiment of the church is ſpirituall / and reſpecteth the conſcience / &amp; therefore hath not to do with ciuill offices / which reſpect properly the common wealth / and the outward godly honeſt / and quiet behauior. And therefore their meaning is <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as the ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor doth vſe ſuch kinde of puniſhment as may bridle the outward man / &amp; hold hym / that he dare not offende in the open breache of that godlynes / honeſty and quietnes which Saynt Paule commendeth vnto vs: ſo the Eccleſiaſticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyment <note place="margin">1.

For albeit that godlye cyuill magiſtrates doe rule ouer vs in the Lorde / yet Saynt Paule <hi>catexochen</hi> that is / by excellencye / aſcrybeth that vnto the Eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernoures / becauſe that whereas the cyuill magiſtrate beſyde hys care for the ſaluation of the ſoules of hys people / is occupyed in procuring alſo the wealth and quyetnes of thys lyfe: the Eccleſiaſticall gouernors haue all their whole care ſet vpon that only <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which perteyneth to the lyfe to come. And to thys end alſo is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the admonition / the place of Tim. wherein the apoſtle teacheth part of the eccleſiaſticall dyſciplyne which the myniſter may vſe / to conſiſt in reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rebukes / which muſt be tempered according as the eſtate and age of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one doth require. Theyr meaning is not (as M.

               <p>Now that I haue ſhewed that the places quoted by the admonition / are for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part to the purpoſe of that they be quoted for / I wil adde a reaſon or two to thys pourpoſe / before I come to anſwer to thoſe reaſons which are brought by M. Doctor. Here I muſt deſire the reader to remember (which I ſayde before / when I ſpake agaynſt <hi>non reſidencie)</hi> the multitude &amp; difficultie of thoſe things which are required of the myniſter of the word of God. And with all I wil leaue to the conſyderation of euery one / the great infirmitie and weakenes which is in men / both the which conſyderations ſet together / it will eaſely appeare how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete a thing it is / that the myniſter ſhoulde haue any other charge layde vppon hym / ſeeing that it being ſo wayghty an office / as will require all the gyftes he hath / be they neuer ſo great / it muſt needes fall out / that ſo much as he doth in an other calling / ſo much he leaueth vndone in thys. And what the hand of man is able to reach herein / it is to be conſidered in the apoſtles / whome if the office of the myniſtery dyd ſo wholy occupy and ſet a worke / that they could admyt no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charge with it / yea / &amp; were fayne to caſt of that which they had / it is cleare that none of thoſe which lyue now / can beſyde that function / admytte any other publyke calling. The ſtory is knowen in the Actes / that the apoſtles euen du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">6. Actes. 2.</note> the tyme that they kept together at Ieruſalem / and taught the church there / were fayne / that they might the better attend vnto preaching and praying / (by which two things S. Luke ſummarely ſetteth forth the office of the myniſtery) to geue ouer the charge of prouiding for the poore vnto others / becauſe they were not hable to doe both. Now for ſo much as the Apoſtles endued with ſuch giftes as none haue bene ſince / or ſhalbe hereafter / coulde not diſcharge together with the office of the myniſter that alſo of the deacon / how ſhould any man be founde / that together with that office / can diſcharge the office of a ciuill magiſtrate? And if the Apoſtles would not haue the office of a Deacon / which was eccleſiaſticall / and therefore of the ſame kynde with the myniſtery ioyned vnto it / how much leſſe will they ſuffer that the myniſtery ſhould be ioyned with a ciuill office / and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of an other kynde? For reaſon teacheth that there is an eaſyer mingling of thoſe which are of one kynd / then of thoſe which are of dyuers kyndes. Agayne / how can we iuſtly reproue the papiſtes for the vſe of both the ſwordes / ſpirituall / and materiall / when as we are found in the ſame fault our ſelues? And ſurely howſoeuer long cuſtome hath cauſed it to ſeme / yet in deede it is a very great and vntollerable confuſion / which may be the eaſelyer vnderſtanded / if ſo be we ſet before our eyes / how vncomely and diſordered it is / in the lyke / or rather in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame caſe. For let vs imagine the Mayor or Baylife of a towne / or the King or Emperor of the lande / to come into the pulpet / and make a ſermon / afterwarde to myniſter the Sacramentes / and from the Church to goe with the ſcepter in hys hand vnto the place of iudgement: who would not be amaſed to ſee this / and wonder at it / as at a ſtraunge and monſtrous ſight? aſſuredly the ſelfe ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity it is / when as the Myniſter of the word / is made a Iuſtice of peace / of Quorum / a Commyſſioner / an Earle / or any ſuch lyke / to whome the iudgement of matters pertayning to the courte of the ciuill Magiſtrate is committed: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing there are (God be prayſed) of the Nobilitie and gentry of the realme / that are able to diſcharge theſe offices much better / then theſe Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:21261:108"/> to whome they are committed. And if ſo be that there fall out any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at any tyme which is to be decided by the word of God / and wherein the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the myniſter is needefull / there the myniſters helpe / may / and ought to bee required. For thereof we haue not only an example in Eſra / where the Princes in a matter of difficultie / came &amp; aſked the counſell of Eſra / but we haue a plaine <note place="margin">Eſra. 9. 1. De. 19. 17. 18.</note> commaundement in Moſes by the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who commaunded that the cauſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury ſhould be heard before the Lord in the ſanctuary / at the hearing wherof the high prieſt ſhuld be preſent / by which commaundement the Lord doth not (by bringing thys cauſe into the ſanctuary) declare / that the iudgement therof dyd ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne vnto the Eccleſiaſticall court / but becauſe it being a matter which tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the glory of God very expreſly / hee woulde haue the Princes which were iudges there / to be the nearer touched / and the depelyer affected with the glory of God / whereof they ſaw the ſacrament before theyr eyes. Neyther is the hyghe prieſt commaunded to be preſent to thys ende / that he ſhould ſitte as iudge of that matter / but that he might diſſolue the difficulties / if any roſe of the vnderſtanding of the law / and that hee myght pricke forward and ſtyre vp by admonition / the Princes to whome the iudgement appertayned / if ſo bee he ſhould ſee them colde &amp; ſlacke to reuenge the iniury done vnto the Lorde. Which thing may the better appeare / in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the handling of the matter / is there appoynted not vnto the prieſtes / but vnto the iudges or princes only / and ſo lykewyſe of matrimony and diuorſe / although the iudgement thereof appertayne vnto the ciuill magiſtrate / yet the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter if there be any difficulty in knowing when it is a lawfull contract / &amp; when the dyuorſe is lawfull / maye and ought to bee conſulted wyth. Thus may the common wealth and church enioy both the wyſedome &amp; learning which is in the myniſter / &amp; things may bee done in that order which God hath appoynted / with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuche confounding and iombling of offyces and iuriſdictions together. For although Ariſtotles <hi>obeliſcolychnion,</hi> and Platoes <hi>dorydrepanon,</hi> that is / inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes ſeruing to two purpoſes / bee lawfull in offyces of the common wealth / where things are more free / and left in greater liberty to bee ordered at the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and aduiſe of men / eſpecially conſydering that vppon the diuerſitye of the formes of common wealthes / varietie of regiment may ſpring: yet in the church of God where things are brought to a ſtrayghter rule / and which is but one and vniforme / the ſame may not bee ſuffered. And yet euen thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers which doe lycence vpon occaſion that two offices may meete in one man / holde that it is beſt and conuenienteſt / that euery one ſhoulde haue a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulare charge. For Ariſtotle ſayeth that it is moſt agreeable to nature / that <hi>hen</hi> ſhoulde be <hi>pros hen,</hi> that is / one inſtrument to one vſe. And Plato vſeth the <note place="margin">Not Hercules hymſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt two.</note> prouerbe <hi>mede heracleis pros duo,</hi> againſt thoſe which wil take vpon them diuers vocations / and not content them ſelues with one / ſo that they make the meting of many functions in one man / to be a remedy only in extreme neede &amp; pouerty of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men. And although both be vnlawfull / yet as the caſe ſtandeth in our realme / it is more tellerable that the ciuill magiſtrate ſhould doe the office of a miniſter / then that the miniſter ſhuld intermeddle with the function of the magiſtrate. For when the accountes ſhall be caſt / it will fall out / that there are more ſufficient &amp; able men to ſerue in the common wealth of thys realme / then in the churche / and greater wante in the one then in the other. And if beſyde thys / both authoritie of the werd of God and lyght of reaſon / wee will looke vnto the practiſe of the church many yeares after the time of the Apoſtles / we ſhall finde that the church hath bene very carefull from time to time / that thys order ſhould bee kept / that the miniſters ſhuld not entangle them ſelues with any thing beſide their miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry / and thoſe things which the word of God doth neceſſaryly put vpon them / le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21261:109"/> may alſo partly appeare by that which I haue alledged out of Cyprian / which will not permit them ſo much as to bee executors of a Teſtament. And in one of the Canons whiche are aſcribed vnto the Apoſtles it is enioyned that they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Can. Apofl.</hi> 80.</note> ſhould not entangle them ſelues with worldly offices / but attend vpon their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall affaires.</p>
               <p>Further / in the councell of Calcedon it was decreed / that none of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>con. Calced. can.</hi> 3.</note> clearkes or cleargie (as it termeth them) ſhoulde receiue any charge of thoſe which are vnder age / vnleſſe they were ſuche as the lawes dyd neceſſarily caſt vpon hym / which it calleth inexcuſable charges / meaning by all lykelyhoode / the wardſhyp of hys brothers children or ſome ſuche thing. Where is alſo declared the cauſe of that decree to haue beene / for that there were certeine myniſters which were ſtewardes to noble men. And in the. 7. canon of the ſame councell it is decreed / that none of the cleargy ſhould either goe to warfare as ſouldyers or captaynes / or ſhould receiue any ſecular honors / and if they dyd / they ſhoulde bee excommunicated or accurſed. Now I come to M. Doctors argumentes / which he bringeth to eſtabliſh thys diſorder.</p>
               <p>And firſt he ſayeth myniſters of the word may not occupy them ſelues in wordly buſines / as to be marchants / huſbandmen / craftes men / and ſuch like / but they may exerciſe cyuill offices. Where firſt of all I perceiue M. Doctor is of thys mynde / that the order of God is not to be broken for ſmall gayne / or when a man muſt take great toyle of the body to breake it: but it may be broken with getting of honor / and doing of thoſe things which may be done with out ſoyle / &amp; with great commendation / there it is lawfull to breake it. In deede ſo the Poete (but in the perſon of an vniuſt and ambition man / ) ſayd: <hi>ei chre adicein, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos heneca chre,</hi> that is. If a man muſt do vniuſtly / he muſt doe it to beare rule.</p>
               <p>Secondarely I doe ſee that M. Doctor will not be ſhackled and hyndered from hys miniſtery by a paire of yron fetters / but if he can get a payre of golden fetters / he is conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to be hampered and entangled / from doing the office of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery committed vnto hym. For onles theſe ſhould be the cauſes which ſhould moue hym to take the one / and refuſe the other / verely I ſee none. For where as he ſayth it is a helpe / &amp; maynteineth relygion / in deede that is the reaſon of the papiſtes which M. Caluin confuteth in hys inſtitution. And although it be good <note place="margin">4. <hi>li. cap.</hi> 11.</note> and neceſſary to puniſh vice and iniquity / by corporall puniſhmentes and by cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill corrections: yet it doth no more follow that that ſhould be done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters / then it followeth that for that preaching and myniſtring the ſacramentes and excommunication are good and neceſſary / therefore the ſame is fitte to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted by the cyuill magiſtrate. I graunt the myniſters haue alſo to punyſhe vice / for as the cyuill magiſtrates puniſhe lyghter faultes with ſome penalty of money or loſſe of membre: ſo the churche and the myniſter eſpecially with the church / hath to puniſhe faultes by repreſions and rebukes. And as the cyuill magiſtrate puniſheth greater faultes by death: ſo the myniſter with other whiche haue intereſte / hath with the ſworde of excommunication power to kill thoſe which be rebellious / &amp; to cut them from the church / as the other doth from the common wealth. And if it be a helpe to the myniſters office / that he ſhoulde meddle with ciuill puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts / why ſhuld it not be a helpe vnto the magiſtrates office / that he ſhould excommunicate and other things pertayning to the eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall diſciplyne? And where as M. Doctor ſayth they may not be huſbandmen / crafts me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp;c. &amp; yet may haue ciuil offices / I thinke far otherwiſe / that although neither be lawfull / yet the one were more tollerable then the other. For ſeing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the miniſtery of the word / there is no calling vnder the ſunne weightyer / and which requireth greater exerciſe of the mynde / then the office of the magiſtrate / it is agaynſt all reaſon to lay this heauy burthen vpon a man that is already loden / and hath as much as he is able to beare. It were more equall / if they will needes
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21261:109"/> adde vnto the weyght of thys burthen / to lay ſome lyghter charge of exerciſing &amp; handy craft / then to breake hys backe with the charge of a cyuill magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>And whereas in the pollicy of M. Doctor it ſemeth a furtherance to the goſpell to ioyne theſe together which was alſo the pollicy of the Idolaters / (as I haue before declared) in the wiſedome of God it hath ſemed farre otherwyſe / which I doubt not dyd therfore ſeparate the miniſtery from thys pompe / whiche is commendable in the cyuill magiſtrate / leaſt the efficacy and power of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the word of God and of the myniſtery ſhould be obſcured / whileſt men would attribute the conuerſion of ſoules vnto the goſpell (dew vnto the worde and to the ſpirite of God) to theſe gloryous ſhewes. And leaſt whyleſt the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſter haue the woorde in one hande / and the ſword in the other / men ſhould not be able to iudge ſo well in their conſciences of the mighty operation of the worde of God in them. For they might doubt with them ſelues / whether the feare &amp; out ward ſhew of the myniſter / caryed ſome ſtroke with them in beleuing the word.</p>
               <p>But M. Doctor ſayeth / that cyuill offices are not to be counted worldly affayres / but heauenly and ſpirituall / it is ſo / and yet when they are compared with the eccleſiaſticall offices / they may be called ſecular offices / for ſo muche as they together with the care of relygion / procure and prouide for the things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may quietly and commodiouſly lyue here / where the eccleſiaſticall offices are immediatly and only bent / to procure the glory of God and the ſaluation of men / and in that ſignification of heauenly &amp; ſpirituall which you take / marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſe / huſbandry / and the handy craft be heauenly and ſpyrituall / although not in the ſame degree. All lawfull callinges came from God / &amp; returne to hym agayne / that is / he is both author of them / and they ought to be referred to hys glory / ſo that if the myniſter may exerciſe all thinges which be heauenly / and ſpirituall / you may as well bring hym downe to the plough / as promote hym to the courte. And whereas M. Doctor ſayth that the office of a commiſſyoner is eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call / becauſe it handleth eccleſiaſticall cauſes / I meruayle that he is ſo ignorant / that he can not put a difference betweene geuing iudyciall ſentences / and appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bodely puniſhmentes (which are meere cyuill) and betweene the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the truth of euery ſuch cauſe according as the worde of God defyneth of it: which is a thing common as wel vnto the magiſtrate as vnto the miniſter / and wherein the myniſter becauſe he ought to be moſt ready / ought (if neede be) conſulted with.</p>
               <p>An other of Maiſter Doctors reaſons is / that as kinges doe ſerue Chriſt by making lawes for hym / ſo byſhoppes doe ſerue Chriſt by executing lawes for him. As though it pertayned not vnto the magiſtrates to execute lawes / aſwell as to make them / and as if the magiſtrate were not therefore called a ſpeaking law / becauſe by executing them / he doth cauſe the lawes after a faſhion to ſpeake. Thys is to deuide the ſtake of the magiſtrate / betwene hym / and the byſhop / yea to geue the byſhoppe the beſt part of it. For wee know that with vs / the people be at making of the lawes / which may not meddle with the execution of them. And if M. Doctor ſay that he meaneth not hereby to ſhut the prince from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the lawes / then as hys ſimilytude (when it is at the beſt) proueth nothing: ſo by thys meanes it haltes downe ryght / and is no ſimylitude. As for Elie and Samuell they are extraordinary examples / which may thereby appeare / for that both theſe offices firſt meting in Melchiſedech / &amp; afterward in Moſes / were by the commaundement of God ſeuered / when as the Lord toke from Moſes (being ſo wiſe &amp; godly a man) the prieſthode / &amp; gaue it to Aaron / and to hys ſucceſſors. And ſo / for ſo much as when the Lord would poliſhe hys church / &amp; make it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous / &amp; renoumed in the world / he gaue thys order: It appeareth that he wold haue this to be a perpetuall rule vnto his church. And by ſo much it is the clearer / for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord did not tary vntil Moſes death / but toke the prieſthode away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:21261:110"/> Moſes / which was a man as able to execute both / as eyther Elie / or Samuell. And thys may be alſo eaſely ſeene / for that in a maner alwayes / where there was any good and ſtayed eſtate of the churche / theſe offices were myniſtred by ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perſons / and then met &amp; were mingled / when the eſtates were very ruinous and myſerable. And if thys be a good reaſon to proue that myniſters may exerciſe ciuill offices / it is as good a reaſon to proue / that princes may preach / and myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſacramentes. For if the myniſters may exerciſe ciuill offices / becauſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie / and Samuell (being myniſters) did ſo: the Princes / and Iudges may preach the word / and myniſter the ſacramentes / becauſe Elie and Samuell (being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and iudges) dyd ſo. And ſo we ſee / how M. Doctor going about / to defende one confuſion / bringeth in an other.</p>
               <p>As for Elias killing the falſe prophetes / and our ſauiour Chriſtes whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of the temple / it is ſtrange that Maiſter Doctor will alledge them / as thinges to be followed / when he may as well teach / that we may cal for fire from heauen / as Elias dyd / and being demaunded / anſwere nothing / as our ſauiour dyd: as to follow theſe actions which are moſt ſingular / and extraordinary. And if theſe one / or two examples be enough to breake the order that God hath ſet / by thys a man may proue / that the myniſters may be fyſhers / and tent makers / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 3. Act. 18. 3.</note> Peter / and Paule (being myniſters) dyd fyſhe and make tents. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe are not ſo extraordinary / and from the generall rule / as the other be. And it was permitted in a councell / that rather then a myniſter ſhould haue two bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>concil. Nice. ca.</hi> 15.</note> / he might labor with hys handes / to ſupply hys want withall. When S. Paule willed Tim. that he ſhould not receiue an accuſation agaynſt an elder / vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two or three witneſſes / he dyd commit nothing les / then any ciuill office vnto hym. And M. Doctor hym ſelfe hath alledged it before / as a thing incident to the office of a byſhop: and therefore he doth forget hymſelfe maruellouſly now / that maketh thys a ciuill office.</p>
               <p>And doth M. Doctor thincke / that S. Paule made magiſtrates? Or is he of that iudgement / that the church in the tyme of perſecution / may make ciuill officers? But it is true / that he that is once ouer the ſhoes / ſticketh not to run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hys bootes.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all to proue that byſhoppes may haue priſons / hee citeth Peter which punyſhed Ananias / and Saphira with death. M. Doctor muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that thys was Eccleſiaſticall power / and was done by vertue of that func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / which S. Paule calleth <hi>dynamin,</hi> which is one of thoſe functions that the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 28.</note> Lord placed in hys church for a tyme. But is thys a good argument / becauſe S. Peter puniſhed with the word / therefore the myniſter may punyſhe with the ſworde? And becauſe S. Peter dyd ſo once / therefore the byſhop may doe ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? &amp; becauſe S. Peter dyd that / which appertayneth to no ciuill magiſtrate / and which no ciuill magiſtrate / by any meanes may / or can doe / therefore the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may doe that / which appertayneth vnto the ciuill magiſtrate? For if there had bene a ciuill magiſtrate / the ſame could not haue punyſhed thys fault of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation / which was not knowen / nor declared it ſelfe by any outwarde action. So that if thys example proue any thing / it proueth that the myniſter may doe / that no man may doe / but the Lord only / which is to punyſh faultes that are hyd / and vnknowne. If thys be ignoraunce / it is very groſſe / &amp; if it be agaynſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge / it is more daungerous. I haue determyned with my ſelfe / to leaue vnto M. Doctor hys outcries and declamations / and if I ſhould haue vſed them / as often as he geueth occaſion / there would be no end of wryting. The Lord geue M. Doctor eyther better knowledge / or better conſcience.</p>
               <p>Vnto M. Doctor / aſking where it appeareth that pope Eugenius brought in pryſons into the church / as alſo vnto three or foure ſuch like demaunds which hee maketh in thys booke / the authors of the Admonition anſweare at once / that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21261:110"/> thys and the other are ſounde in Pantaleon and M. Bales Chronicles. Heere I will take in that / whych the byſhop of Saleſbury hath in the laſt page of hys halfe ſheete touching thys matter.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all I wel agree / that he ſayth / that to geue vnto ſathan (which is to excommunicate / and to correct an Eccleſiaſticall perſon by reprehenſyon / or putting hym out of the miniſterye / if the caſe ſo require) is meere eccleſiaſticall / and not ciuill / and that thoſe thyngs ought to be done of the offycers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church. Thys only I deny / that the miniſters ought to meddle wyth ciuill offyces. For proofe whereof / the B. alledgeth the example of Auguſtine / whych as Poſſido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius wryteth / was troubled wyth the hearing &amp; determinyng of cauſes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Poſſidonius ſayeth nothyng / but that I willingly agree vnto. For the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter wyth the elders / ought bothe to heare / and determine of cauſes / but of ſuche cauſes / as pertaine vnto their knowledge / whereof I haue ſpoken before. And that Poſſidonius ment ſuch cauſes as belonged vnto Auguſtin / as he was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter / and not of ciuill affaires / it appeareth by that whych he wryteth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after / where he ſayth. Being alſo conſulted of / by certen in their worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires / he wrote epiſtles to diuers / but he accompted of thys / as of compulſyon / and reſtraint from hys better buſyneſſes: whereby it appeareth / that S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine medled not wyth thoſe worldly affaires / further / then by waye of giuing counſell / whych is not vnlawful for a miniſter to do / as one friend vnto an other / ſo that hys myniſterye be not thereby hindered. And for the truthe of thys mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / that miniſters ought not to meddle wyth ciuill affaires / I will appeale to no other / then to the byſhop hym ſelfe / who dothe affirme plainly the ſame / that the <note place="margin">The byſhop of Sarum / in the defence of the Apollogie / in the. 5. part. 4. chap. and. 2. ſection. 1. Pet. 4. 15.</note> admonition heere affirmeth.</p>
               <p>And therfore I conclude / that for ſo much as bothe the holy ſcriptures doe teache / that miniſters oughte not to meddle wyth ciuill offyces / and reaſon / and the practiſe of the church doe confirme it / that they ought to kepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limites of the miniſterye / and Eccleſiaſticall functions / leaſt whileſt they breake forthe into the calling of a magiſtrate / in ſteade of ſhewing themſelues <hi>epiſcopous,</hi> that is ouerſeers / they be found to declare themſelues * <hi>allotriopiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous,</hi> that is: buſy bodyes / medling in thyngs whych belong not vnto them.

               <p>Vnto the two next ſections I haue ſpoken in that whych hathe bene ſayde touchyng excommunication / canons / and prebendaries. &amp;c. and vnto that whych is contained in the. 226. and. 227. I anſwere that I can not excuſe couetous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of benefices / but couetous parſons and vicars be a great plague vnto this church / and one of the principall cauſes of rude and ignorant people.</p>
               <p>Lykewiſe vnto the two next ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s I haue anſweared before / in ſpeaking againſt the ſpirituall courts / whych are now vſed / and vnto the next after that / in ſpeaking of the ordayning of miniſters. And vnto that whych is contained in the later ende of the. 234. and the beginning of the. 235. I ſay that the church ſhall iudge of the aptnes or vnaptnes of our reaſons / and albeit we do finde fault with diuers thyngs in the booke / yet we neyther oppugne as enemyes / nor are by the grace of God eyther Papiſts / Anabaptiſts / Atheiſts / or Puretanes / as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth M.

               <p>Vnto the next ſection I haue anſweared in the treatiſe of the apparell. And vnto the next after / in the treatiſe whych declareth to whome it doth appertaine to make ceremonyes and orders of the church. And vnto the ſection contained in the. 243. page / I ſay that M.

               <p>HEre maiſter Doctor / contrary to the proteſtation of the authors of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition / whych declare that for the abuſes / and corruptions / they dare not ſimply ſubſcribe / ſayth / that therfore they will not ſubſcribe / becauſe they are required by lawfull authoritye. Whych howe bothe preſumptuous and vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a iudgement it is / let all men iudge / eſpecially vpon this matter whych hath bene declared. And where maiſter Doctor wold vpon the marginall note / proue that we haue good diſcipline / becauſe we haue good doctrine / and thervpon doth wonderfully tryumphe / he playeth as he of whome it is ſayde / <hi>meden labon cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tei carteros,</hi> that is / hauyng gotten nothyng / holdeth it faſt. For can M. doctor be ſo ignorant / that thys manner of ſpeach (doctrine and diſcipline can not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered) is vſed for that / that they ought not to be ſeuered? when we ſay (folowing S. Paule) that we can do nothing againſt the truth / doe we not meane that we ought to do nothyng / nor can do nothyng lawfully agaynſt it? And do not al men knowe when we ſay that a man can not be ſeparated from hys wyfe / but for the cauſe of adultery / that we meane he ought not / or he cannot lawfully? Therfore thys is / as (all men may ſee) a mere cauill / and triumph ouer hys owne ſhadow. There is no brag of ſuffering made by the authors of the admonition.

               <p>Finally / as you exhorte vs to ſubmit our ſelues to good order / whych haue ben alwayes / and yet are ready to do: to leaue to be contentious / which neuer yet began: to ioyne wyth you in preaching the word of God / which haue ſtopped our mouthes / and wil not ſuffer vs to preache: ſo we exhorte you in Gods behalfe / &amp; as you will once anſwere it before the iuſt iudge / that you wil not willingly ſhut your eyes againſt the truthe / that if the Lord vouchſafe to open it vnto you / you kicke not agaynſt it.

               <head>Vnto maſter Doctors cenſures vpon the additions / detractions / and alterations of bothe the partes of the admonition.</head>
               <p>BEſydes that oftentimes M. Doctor dothe accounte the expoſitions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations / corrections / he leaueth vs ſomewhat the les hope / that he wil cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect hys errors / for that he purſueth the authors of the admonition ſo harde / correcting their very ſmal and few ſlips which they haue made / calling thys ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulare modeſtye / and commendable humility amongſte other reproches / dalying and inconſtancye / when it is oure profeſſion euery day to learne better thyngs. For vnto what ende ſhould we lyue / if time / if experience / if reading / if muſing / if conference ſhould teache vs nothyng? And therefore / when thyngs are Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe / it is good and prayſe worthy / to polliſh thoſe things whych are ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what rude / to mitigate thoſe things whych are to ſharpe / to make plaine / and to geue lighte to thoſe things whych ſeeme darker / and to correcte that whych is a miſſe. I thinke M. Doctor ſhoulde not be ignorante / that wiſe men haue their <hi>deuteras phrontidas,</hi> their ſeconde counſels / and thoſe alſo wyſer and better then their firſt / as that ſentence doth declare. I will therfore ſay no more heereof / but admoniſhe M. Doctor that he receiue more louingly thoſe whych correcte them ſelues / ſeing that the beſt defence to hys booke muſt be / not a correction here and there / but a cleane blotting and ſtriking out / not an amending / but a new making almoſte of hys whole booke. Other matter in hys cenſures / he hath almoſt none at all worthe the anſwearing / ſauing that he hathe a place or two whych touch the matters before entreated of. For whereas he accuſeth the authors of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition in the firſt leafe / as though they ſhould condemne Doctors and bachel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of diuinitie / and ſo bryng in confuſion of degrees / he vpon the. 5. leafe / con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that they allowe of a Doctor. Althoughe he that taketh away degrees of Doctor or Bachelor of Diuinitie / dothe not bryng in confuſion / nor taketh not away all degrees of ſchooles / eſpecially ſeeing they are nowe made bare names wythout any offices / and oftentimes they are admitted to theſe degrees / whych neyther can / nor will teache.</p>
               <p>Vnto the ſeconde leafe of the addition of the ſecond parte of the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / maſter D. ſaith / that becauſe the third to Titus maketh not againſt reading / 
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:21261:112"/> therfore it maketh not againſt reading miniſters / that is / miniſters that can doe nothyng but reade.</p>
               <p>And wheras he would picke out a contradiction in the words of the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition / becauſe they ſay bare reading / is but bare feading / the diſcorde is in hys cares / not in their wordes. For when they ſayde it was no feading / they meant ſuche feeding as could ſaue them / and ſo in calling it bare feading / they note that there is not enough in that / to keepe them from famiſhment. And in deede / vnles the Lord worke miraculouſly and extraordinarily (whych is not to beloked for of vs) the bare reading of the ſcriptures wythout the preachyng / can not delyuer ſo much as one poore ſheepe from deſtruction / and from the wolfe. And if ſome haue ben conuerted wonderfully / yet M. doctor ſhould remember that <hi>potamos ouc aei axinas pherei,</hi> that is. The water doth not alway beare iron.</p>
               <p>And vpon the thirde leafe / where he geueth inſtance in the Apocalypſe of the worde (prieſt) to be taken otherwyſe / then for the Leuiticall prieſthode / and prieſthode of our ſauioure Chriſte. Maiſter D. can not be ignorant / that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition ſpeaketh of thoſe which be prieſts in deede / &amp; properly / and not by thoſe whych are prieſts by a Metaphore and borowed ſpeache. And whereas he deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to learne where the word (prieſt) is taken in euill parte in all the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Although all men ſee how he aſketh thys queſtion of no minde to learne: yet if he will learne (as he ſayeth) he ſhall finde that in the actes of the apoſtles / it is taken diuers tunes in euill parte. For ſeeing that the office and function of <hi>ron iereon,</hi> that is / of prieſts / was (after our ſauyor Chriſtes aſcencion) naught and vngodly: The name wherby they were called / whych dyd exerciſe that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly function / can not be otherwyſe taken / then in the euill parte.</p>
               <p>M. Doctor vpon the. 5. leafe / citeth M. Caluins authority / to proue that the laying on of the handes vpon yong children / and the Confirmation whych is heere vſed / is good. In the whych place / although he allow of a kinde of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation / yet he doth not commende that whych we haue. For he dothe plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue Ierom / for ſaying that it came from the apoſtles / whych notwythſtanding the Confirmation wyth vs dothe affirme. Beſydes that / there are other abuſes whych I haue noted there / whych M. Caluin doth not by any word allow. He alloweth in deede of a putting on of handes of the children / when they come oute of their childehode / or begin to be yong men / but as well as he doth allow of it / he was one of thoſe whych did thruſte it oute of the churche / where he was paſtor. And ſo he alloweth of it / that he bryngeth (in the ſixt ſection of the ſame chapter) a ſtrong reaſon to abolyſhe it. Where he aſketh / what the impoſition of handes ſhould do now / ſeeing that the geuing of the giftes of the holy ghoſt by that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is ceaſed. Therfore / ſeeing that we haue M. Caluins reaſon againſt thys impoſition of hands / hys name ought not to be preiudiciall vnto vs: eſpecially / ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we haue experience of great inconuenyences whych come by it / whych M. Caluin coulde not haue / that thyng being not in vſe in that church where he lyued. Whych inconuenience in thyngs whych are not neceſſary / oughte to be a iuſt cauſe of abolyſhing of them. And thys is not my iudgement only / but the iudgement of the churches of Heluetia / Berne / Tigurine / Geneua / Scotlande / and diuers others / as appeareth in the. 19. chapter of their confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Vpon the. 6. leafe / M. Doctor ſayth that the Pope taketh the ſword from Princes / but our byſhops take it at their hands / and geuen of them: as thoughe chalenge were not made agaynſt the Pope / for vſing the materiall ſworde / and not only for vſing it againſt the wil of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes. For by that reaſon / if Prynces would put their ſwordes in hys hand / as ſometymes they haue done / he myghte lawfully vſe them. And wheras he ſayeth / that our church men meddle not with all ciuill cauſes / or exerciſe all ciuill iuriſdiction / but ſuche as helpeth to diſcipline / and the good gouernment of the church / and the ſtate: What ſayth he / that is not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21261:112"/> truely ſayd of any ciuill magiſtrate in the realme? for no one dothe meddle in all cauſes. And further / I woulde gladly knowe what ciuill iuriſdiction is in thys realme / whych helpeth not vnto the good gouernment of thys church / and ſtate. For if they meddle wyth all that / there is none whych they haue not to do with.</p>
               <p>Vpon the. 7. leafe / he ſayth / that he knoweth not the meaning of the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition / when it proueth that the gouernment of the church is ſpiritual / their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is plaine enoughe / and I haue declared it more at large to be / not only that our ſauyor Chriſt ruleth by hys ſpirite in the hearts of hys elect (beſides whych gouernment M. doctor ſeemeth to know none.) But that there is alſo ſpiritual gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t / whych is in the whole church viſible / &amp; to be ſene / exerciſed by thoſe / whome God hath appoynted in hys ſtead / called ſpirituall / becauſe where as the ciuill gouernment vſeth the ſword / thys vſeth the word: and where the ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor addreſſeth hymſelfe vnto the bodye / and hathe that for ſpeciall matter to worke on / the ſpirituall gouernors be occupied in reforming the minde / and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing that wyth thoſe puniſhments and corrections / whych God hath appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpoſe. Whych ſignification of ſpirituall gouernment / M. Caluine doth ſpeake of in bothe the places alledged by M. doctor: and eſpecially in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / vnto whom the admonition ſent the reader / not therby to giue more waight vnto the truth / but that he myght haue there a plainer / and fuller vnderſtanding of that whych it meant / and could not for that breuity and ſhortnes whych it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth throughout / vtter at large. Wherby it is manifeſt / that the admonition is ſo farre from ſhutting out eyther ciuill gouernment / or externall gouernment in the church / that it teacheth of an externall gouernment whych M. doctor ſemeth not to haue heard of / allbeit there be nothing eyther more common in the ſcryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures / or Eccleſiaſticall wryters.</p>
               <p>Vpon the. 8. leafe / M. doctor ſayth he ſeeth nothyng / howe the place of the Epheſians maketh any thing againſt this maner of ſpeach of the biſhop (receiue the holy ghoſt) and yet it maketh thus much / that for as much as the apoſtles did vſe to pray that the grace of God might be geuen vnto men / the byſhops ſhoulde not vſe this manner of ſpeache / which containeth the forme of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement.</p>
               <p>Vpon the. 9. leafe he hath ſondry greeuous accuſations and charges of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order / diſobedience / and contempt againſt thoſe whych refuſe the apparel / and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to perſuade that they are great and waighty matters. But hys profes were ſpent before.</p>
               <p>As for anſweare to the articles collected out of the admonition / it is made in the Replie vnto M. Doctors boke / where I haue ſhewed howe the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is miſconſtrued / and taken otherwiſe / then either it meaneth or ſpeaketh / whervnto I will referre the reader.</p>
               <p>And albeit I haue ſhewed how vntrue it is / that the admonition affirmeth that there is no church in England / yet I can not pas by the ſecrete philoſophy whereby M. doctor would proue / that the authors of the admonition affirme it. For ſayth he by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of Philoſophie. <hi>Quod vix fit, non fit,</hi> that which is ſkarce done / is not done. I ſay this is ſecrete / for it was neuer taughte / neither in <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demia,</hi> nor in <hi>Stoa,</hi> nor <hi>Lyceo.</hi> I haue red <hi>Quod fere fit, non fit,</hi> that whych is almoſt done / is not done. But I neuer remembre any ſuch rule / as M. Doctor ſpeaketh of.</p>
               <p>And beſides that in our tonge / thoſe thyngs whych <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Pet. 4. 18.</note> that iuſt men ſhall not be ſaued. The reſt of that I haue anſweared.</p>
               <p>And wheras he ſayth that it is all one / to ſay that the election of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt be made by the church / and to ſay / it muſt be made by the people: It is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:21261:113"/> a great ouerſyghte to make the parte / and whole all one / ſeeing the people be but one parte of the churche / and the miniſter and the other gouernoures are / allbeit not the greateſt / yet the principalleſt part. I graunt that ſometimes a part is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the whole / and ſo we do call ſometimes the gouernors of the churche the churche / and ſometimes the people. But where the queſtion is of the proprietye of theſe ſpeaches (the churche and the people) there all men that haue any iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / can eaſely put a difference. The reſt of thoſe articles are anſweared in the diſcourſe of the booke. Beſydes that / the faultes whych are found wyth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true gathering of them / are not taken away by M. Doctor / but only in confident and bolde aſſeuerations. And if I ſhould ſay any thyng / I ſhould but repeate their wordes.</p>
               <p>In the viewe of the ſecond admonition / M. Doctor dothe as it ſeemeth of purpoſe / cull out thoſe thyngs whych he hath ſpoken on before / and in repeatyng of them / referreth hys reader vnto hys boke. Diuers other matters there are / of great weight / whych he ſpeaketh not of / if he doe approue them / it had bene well he had ſignified hys liking: if he do not / that he had confuted them. And if he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed ſo heauely of brynging forth of thys booke / that it was as heauy a burden vnto him / as Salomon ſayth a fond word is vnto an vnwiſe man: he might haue taken day to anſwere it. Nowe by this ſlender anſwearing of it / or rather not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing at all / but only aſking howe thys and that is proued / (where as being proued / it is vnreproued of hym) he doth his cauſe more harme / then he is aware of. For vnles hys proufes be ioyned wyth his expulſions / impriſonments / and with all that racket whych he maketh in Cambridge to the vttermoſt of that his authority will ſtretch vnto / he may be well aſſured / that their driuing out / will draw in the truth / and their impriſonment / will ſet the truth at greater libertye / and therby proue it ſelfe to be neither Papiſtry / nor Anabaptiſtry / Donatiſtry / Cathariſme / nor any other hereſy whych are by due correction repreſſed. But as for the truthe of God / the more it is laden / the ſtraighter it ſtandeth / and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more it is kept vnder / the more it enforceth it ſelfe to riſe / and will vndoubtedly gette vp / howe great ſo euer the ſtone be / whych is layd vpon it. And albeit he had no leaſure to anſwere the matters whych required his anſwere / yet he carpeth at by matters / and aſketh who are meant by the politicke Macheuils.</p>

For the reaſon whych our ſauior Chriſt vſeth / to draw men from this fault leadeth to thys tranſlation / and can not ſtand with that ſenſe / which M. doctor ſetteth downe. For how ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g theſe togither: you ſhall not babble many wordes wythout faithe. &amp;c. becauſe your heauenly father knoweth / what you haue nede of / before you aſke? It is vnlike firſt / that our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyor Chriſt wold ſpeake thus (babble not many words w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out fayth. &amp;c.) when as rather he would haue forbidden them to ſpeake any one word without fayth. &amp;c. For if he ſhould ſpeake thus / he ſhuld ſeeme to haue alowed a prayer without fayth / ſo that it were not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued in many words. And againe / if (as M. doctor ſayth) this had bene the propoſition / whych our ſauyor Chriſt diſſwaded from / y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they ſhould not babble many words wythout faith. &amp;c. he would neuer haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thys reaſon / (for your heauenly father knoweth. &amp;c.) for neyther is he father vnto any ſuch: And he woulde rather haue ſayd as S. Iames ſayeth / that they <note place="margin">Chap. 1. 7.</note> ſhould be ſure to receiue nothyng / becauſe they aſke not in faythe. Nowe as thys reaſon can not ſtand wyth M. Doctors interpretation: ſo doth it wel agree with the tranſlation of the Geneua Bible. For what could be more fitly ſayd to driue the diſciples from thys vain repetition / then to ſay / that the heauenly father kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth. &amp;c. and that it is not wyth the Lord / as it is wyth men / that muſte haue a thyng oftentimes ſpoken / or euer they can vnderſtand it? Furthermore / what a reaſon is thys: VVe muſt repeat the Lordes prayer oftentimes / therfore we muſt repeate it oftentimes in halfe an houre / and one in the necke of an other? And if ſ. Paules place to the Theſſalonians / (pray continually) be referred vnto the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lordes prayer (as M. doctor would beare vs in hande) then it is not lawfull for vs to vſe any other words / then thoſe whych our ſauyor Chriſt vſed. But I could neuer yet learne / that thoſe wordes binde vs of neceſſity / any more vnto the repetition of the Lordes prayer word for word / then vnto the repetition of any other godly prayer in the ſcripture. And I would be lothe to ſaye that it were ſimply neceſſary / to vſe that iuſt nombre of wordes / and neyther more / nor les at any time / much les oftentimes in ſo ſmall a ſpace. For our ſauyor Chriſte doth not there geue a preſcript forme of prayer / whervnto he bindeth vs: but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs a rule and ſquire to frame all our prayers by / as I haue before declared. I knowe it is neceſſary to pray / and to pray often. I knowe alſo that in ſo fewe words it is impoſſible for any man to frame ſo pithy a prayer: And I confes that the churche doth well in concluding theyr prayers wyth the Lordes prayer: but I ſtande vpon thys / that there is no neceſſitye layde vpon vs / to vſe theſe verye wordes and no more / and eſpecially that the place of S. Paule to the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians dothe leaſt of all proue it. As for M. Doctors outcryes / he hathe ſo often worn our eares wyth them / and that wythout cauſe / that I thinke by this time / no man regardeth them.</p>

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:21261:114"/> a libell: For the doctrine / it appeareth by that whych is ſayd / what it is. And if he wold define what a libell were / it were eaſy to anſwere vnto the other poynt. If he meane becauſe it was preferred wythout any name vnto it / howe will he anſwer vnto the example of the wryter of the Epiſtle vnto the Hebrues / which was a ſinguler inſtrument / and did not ſubſcribe hys Epiſtle / wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding / he ſharply rebuketh diuers faultes amongſt them. And yet the wryter to the Hebrues / was not the miniſter of Sathan. And if he call it a libel / becauſe it vſeth ſome ſharper ſpeaches / ſurely all men ſee that hys boke deſerueth then to be called a Satyre / hauing for tarte wordes / bitter / and for one / twentie. But in what reſpecte ſo euer he call it a libell / he accuſeth not ſo much the authors of the admonition for preferring of it / as diuers of the honourable houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / whych dyd alowe it. Where as maiſter Doctor compareth vs wyth the Phariſeis / and ſayeth we doe all to be ſeene of men / and that we hold downe our heades in the ſtreates / and ſtraine at a gnatte / ſwalowing downe a Camell / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in all mennes knowledge / I will leaue it to them to iudge of the truthe of thoſe thyngs. Where he ſayeth we ſeldome / or neuer laughe / it is not therefore that we thincke that it is not lawfull to laughe / but that the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the calamities of other churches / and of the ruines of oures / wyth the heauy iudgements of the Lord whych hang ouer vs / ought to turne oure laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into weeping / beſides that a man may laugh / although he ſhew not his tethe.

               <p>After M. Doctor confuteth hys owne ſhadowe. For the exhortation doth not require that the name of a brother ſhuld deliuer the authors of the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from puniſhment if they deſerued it / but deſireth that it myghte worke ſome moderation of the rigoure of it / and compaſſion to miniſter to their neceſſities in priſon. He ſayeth that the authors of the Admonition / take not them for theyr brethren / yes verely / although vnbrotherly handled / &amp; for fathers to / and ſo both loue them / and reuerence them / vntil (whych we hope wil not be) they ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly for the vpholding of their owne kingdome and profite / refuſe to haue Chriſte raigne ouer vs / in whome thys fatherhoods and brotherhoode doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte.</p>
               <p>I knowe not whether they haue bene conferred wyth or no / but I thynke the firſt reaſon whych they had to perſwade them / was / that they ſhoulde goe to Newgate / whych is that / which the Exhortation complaineth of after / that they are firſt puniſhed / before they be taught.

                  <head>9. The iudgement of thoſe late wryters touching ceremonies and apparell / whoſe ſecret Epiſtles M. Doctor alledgeth / appeareth by theſe places folowing / cited but of their workes Printed / and publiſhed by them ſelues. Wherof alſo ſome are alledged by the anſwerer to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner / where are diuers other places to thys purpoſe / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I referre the Reader.</head>
                  <p>M. Bucer vpon the. 18. of Math. ſayth that they ſay nothing / which doe alwayes obiect / that greater things muſt be vrged / then the reformation of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies / therby defending the reliques of Antichriſt / foraſmuch as ceremonies are teſtimonies of religion: And that / as there is no agreement betwene Chriſt and Belial / ſo thoſe which are ſincere Chriſtians / can abyde nothing of Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>Peter Martyr vpon the .10. c. of the .2. booke of the kings / ſayeth that the Lutheranes muſt take heede / leaſt whileſt they cut of many popiſhe errors / they follow Iehu by retayning alſo many popiſh things. For they defend ſtill the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preſence in the breade of the ſupper / and images / and veſtmentes. &amp;c. and ſayth that relygion muſt be wholy reformed to the quicke.</p>
                  <p>Bullinger in hys Decades. 5. booke / and. 9. ſermon / ſayth that our ſauior Chriſt &amp; the Apoſtles vſed their accuſtomed apparell in the ſupper / and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in times paſt the miniſters put on a kynde of cloke vppon their common apparell / yet that was done neither by the example of Chriſt / nor of hys Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles / but by the tradition of man / and that in the ende / after the example of the prieſtes apparell in the olde law / it was caſt vpon the myniſters / at the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſupper. But (ſayeth he) we haue learned long agoe / not only that all Leuiticall ceremonies are abrogated / but alſo that they ought to bee brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne into the church of no man. And therefore ſeing we are in the light of the goſpell / and not vnder the ſhadow of the law / we doe worthely reiect / that maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Leuiticall apparell.</p>
                  <p>Gualter vpon the. 21. of the Actes / among others / bringeth thys for one reaſon / to improue Paules ſhauing of hys head: for that the goſpell had beene preached .xx. yeares / and that therefore the infirmitie of the Iewes ought not to haue beene borne with. And after hee ſayeth that that teacheth / how much the ſuperſticious maſters of ceremonyes / hurte the goſpell / which nouriſhe the weakenes of fayth by the long keeping of ceremonyes: and by their long bearing / hynder the doinges of thoſe myniſters / which are more feruent.</p>
